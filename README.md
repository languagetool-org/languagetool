It finds many errors that a simple spell checker cannot detect.

#### How to build from source

Before start: you will need to clone from GitHub (warning, 300+ MB download) and install Java 8 and Apache Maven.

In the root project folder, run:

    mvn clean test

(sometimes you can skip Maven step for repeated builds)

    ./build.sh languagetool-standalone package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-standalone/target/`.

    ./build.sh languagetool-wikipedia package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-wikipedia/target`.

    ./build.sh languagetool-office-extension package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-office-extension/target`, rename the `*.zip` to `*.oxt` to install it in LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

Now you can use the bleeding edge development copy of LanguageTool `*.jar` files, be aware that it might contain regressions.
