#### How to build from source

Before start: you will need to clone from GitHub and install Java 8 and Apache Maven.

Warning: a complete clone requires downloading more than 360 MB and needs more than 500 MB on disk.
This can be reduced if you only need the last few revisions of the master branch
by creating a shallow clone:

    git clone --depth 5 https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool.git

A shallow clone downloads less than 60 MB and needs less than 200 MB on disk.

In the root project folder, run:

    mvn clean test

(sometimes you can skip Maven step for repeated builds)

    ./build.sh languagetool-standalone package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-standalone/target/`.

    ./build.sh languagetool-wikipedia package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-wikipedia/target`.

    ./build.sh languagetool-office-extension package -DskipTests

Test the result in `languagetool-office-extension/target`, rename the `*.zip` to `*.oxt` to install it in LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

Now you can use the bleeding edge development copy of LanguageTool `*.jar` files, be aware that it might contain regressions.
