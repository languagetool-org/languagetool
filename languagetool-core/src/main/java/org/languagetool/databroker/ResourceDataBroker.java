/**
 * Is responsible for getting the necessary resources for the LanguageTool
 * library. Following directories are currently needed by a couple of classes:
 *
 * <ul style="list-type: circle">
 * <li>{@code /resource}</li>
 * <li>{@code /rules}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * This interface determines methods to obtain any contents from these
 * directories.
 * <p>
 *
 * Make sure that you never obtain any LanguageTool resources by calling
 * {@code Object.class.getResource(String)} or {@code
 * Object.class.getResourceAsStream(String)} directly. If you would like to
 * obtain something from these directories do always use
 * {@link JLanguageTool#getDataBroker()} which provides proper methods for
 * reading the directories above.
 * <p>
 *
 * For example, if you want to get the {@link URL} of {@code
 * /rules/de/grammar.xml} just invoke
 * {@link ResourceDataBroker#getFromRulesDirAsUrl(String)} and pass {@code
 * /de/grammar.xml} as a string. Note: The {@code /rules} directory's name isn't
 * passed, because its name might have changed. The same usage does apply for the
 * {@code /resource} directory.
