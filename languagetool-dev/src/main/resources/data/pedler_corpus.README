pedler_corpus.diff is a diff to Jenny Pedler's Real-word Error Corpus, as it
contains some errors that have no markup and this decreases our precision value
(see RealWordCorpusEvaluator.java). Several of these errors have been removed from
the corpus with the diff, but some are also ignored by turning off the corresponding
rule in LanguageTool.
