# English compound words that are usually not written as 
# separate words.
# Encoding: UTF-8
# All words must contain at least one hyphen, even if the
# word is usually not spelled with a hyphen
# "+" at the end of the line will turn off the suggestion that
# uses a hyphen
# "*" at the end of the line will only suggest hyphenated words.
### The following two extensions are probably irrelevant:
# "?" at the end of the line will turn off the suggestion that
# uses a hyphen and offers lower-cased joined suggestions.
# "$" at the end of the line will allow the hyphenated and non-
# hyphenated variants, but will suggest a lower-cased non-hyphenated
# variant
