English (Australian) Dictionary for OpenOffice.org

This dictionary was based on the Australian English Dictionary 
available from http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/spell_dic.html 
(Licensed under the LGPL.) In turn, that dictionary was based on 
the en_GB Myspell dictionary which in turn was initially based on 
a subset of the original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson 
for Pspell and Aspell (also initially licensed under the LGPL.) 

Cameron Roy made some improvements, described in the changelog.txt  
file, and packaged the improved  dictionary for the Australian 
Dictionary Firefox extension. 

David Wilson packaged Cameron Roy's Firefox dictionary into this 
OpenOffice.org extension: dict-en-au.oxt.
