This dictionary was initially based on a subset of the
original English wordlist created by Kevin Atkinson for
Pspell and Aspell and thus is covered by his original
LGPL licence.

It has been extensively updated by David Bartlett, Brian Kelk,
Andrew Brown and Marco A.G.Pinto:
 — Numerous Americanisms/spellings have been removed;
 — Missing words have been added;
 — Many errors have been corrected;
 — Compound hyphenated words have been added where appropriate;
 — Thousands of proper/places names have been added;
 — Thousands of possessives have been added;
 — Thousands of plurals have been added;
 — Thousands of duplicates have been removed.

Valuable inputs to this process were received from many other
people — far too numerous to name. Serious thanks to all for
your greatly appreciated help.

This wordlist is intended to be a good representation of
current modern British English and thus it should be a good
basis for Commonwealth English in most countries of the world
outside North America.

The affix file has been created completely from scratch
by David Bartlett and Andrew Brown, based on the published
rules for MySpell and is also provided under the LGPL.

In creating the affix rules an attempt has been made to
reproduce the most general rules for English word
formation, rather than merely use it to compress the
size of the dictionary. It is hoped that this will
facilitate future localisation to other variants of English.

			 On V2.61–2.64 I included tons of place names.
			 My scientist friend, Peter McGavin, told me that in NZ they use British, so I decided
			 to do something about it. I did the same for UK. I searched on Wikipedia for "towns",
			 "counties", "villages", "boroughs", "suburbs", etc. and based me on:
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_England;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_New_Zealand;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_England;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_Scotland;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_in_Scotland;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_in_Wales;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Wales;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_in_Northern_Ireland;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Northern_Ireland;
			  — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_in_New_Zealand;

MARCO A.G.PINTO:
Since the dictionary wasn't updated for many years, I forked it to add new words and fixes.

I grabbed Mozilla's version since it wasn't obfuscated. Alexandro Colorado and I
tried to unmunch the OpenOffice version but all we got was rubbish.

The dictionary icon in the Extension Manager was designed by Pedro Marques.

The sources used to verify the spelling of the words I included in the dictionary:
 1) Oxford Dictionaries;
 2) Collins Dictionary;
 3) Macmillan Dictionary;
 4) Cambridge Dictionary;
 5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);
 6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);
 7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);
 8) Physical dictionaries.

Main difficulties developing this dictionary:
 1) Proper names;
 2) Possessive forms;
 3) Plurals.

Please let Marco A.G.Pinto know of any errors that you find:
