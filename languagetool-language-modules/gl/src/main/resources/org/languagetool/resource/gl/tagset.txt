The tagset and dictionary used by the Galician tagger on LanguageTool
is based on Freeling with a few modifications we describe below.

You can find a description of the Freeling tagset in this paper:

The differences between the tagset used in LanguageTool and the Freeling
tagset are related with enclitic pronouns. Since this phenomenon is
managed on Freeling by using a set of rules, its dictionary does not include
verbal forms attached to enclitic pronouns. In the Galician module of
LanguageTool this dictionary was enlarged with enclitic forms generated
with lt-expand (Apertium project), and the resulting tag is a union of two
or more tags.

Example: abafoume/VMIS3S0:PP1CS000

This is applied also to contractions.

Example: ao/SPS00:DA0MS0
