The list of Khmer multiple spellings contained in the coherency.txt were taken from Chuon Nath's dictionary.  As best we could we followed the spelling of Chuon Nath's first entry, but at times, we followed a secondary spelling because the first entry's spelling is no longer widely used or recognized.  The purpose of this tool is not to dictate how to spell Khmer words, but to allow publishers to have coherency in their publications in regard to spelling style.  In the future we might consider having an option for the user to choose which spelling style to follow, but currently that is beyond the capability of the script.

The Khmer language was added to LanguageTool by the Society for Better Books in Cambodia http://www.sbbic.org
