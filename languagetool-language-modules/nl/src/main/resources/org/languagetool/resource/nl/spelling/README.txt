The dictionary was created from scratch by TaalTik.

We are aware that this list contains some errors as well as very rare words.

The best way to add or delete words and tags for Dutch is now:

- NOT to have words that are only valid in a fixed word group (like stante, pede, bene from nota bene) in the dictionary
  Those have a much better place in spelling.txt, since these will be checked as a group.
  It is also of little use and hard to give those words a postag.
- Other words are best placed in the binary dictionary. But they could also be added temporarily added to spelling.txt.
