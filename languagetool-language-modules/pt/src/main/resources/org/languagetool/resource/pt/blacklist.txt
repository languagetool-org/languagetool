# This file records dictionary entries frequently added by users that we DO NOT
# want to add to our own spelling dictionary.
#
# This is here to make it easier to identify *new* candidates for the spelling
# dictionary without having to comb through the same list of the usual suspects
# week in, week out.
#
# For now this is used by @p-goulart's script, hopefully we'll also have a GHA
# workflow to check.
#
# Our list is structured thus:
# entry	comments
# other entry	more comments
# separated by a tab char.
