Swedish Dictionary for LibreOffice
Based on Den stora svenska ordlistan

This Swedish Dictionary for Spell Checking is maintained by
Göran Andersson <goran@init.se>.
The most recent version is available at
http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/swedish-spelling-dictionary-den-stora-svenska-ordlistan

Essentially, the dictionary consists of the words that
have been classified in the on-line database at
http://dsso.se/. The on-line database was created by
combining Göran Andersson's ispell dictionary (version 1.3)
and Tom Westerberg's large collection of root words.

If you find a correct Swedish word that is missing from this
dictionary, please go to http://dsso.se/ and insert it
into the database; then it will be included in the next
release of this dictionary.
