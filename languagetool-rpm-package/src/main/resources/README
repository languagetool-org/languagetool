LanguageTool RPM Module
=======================

Introduction
------------

This is a short description LanguageTool RPM module. It primary purpose is to
generate Language Tool RPM package. The package is primarily aimed at RPM-based
Linux distributions. The main goal is to structure LanguageTool so that developers
can easily reinstall and test LT features.

Dependency
----------

LanguageTool RPM module depends on Maven RPM plugin. Plugin's signature is:

<groupId>de.dentrassi.maven</groupId>
<artifactId>rpm</artifactId>
<version>0.9.2</version>


Generation
----------

RPM package is generated as part of packaging phase (Maven goal "package"). It
can also be regenerated at any time by changing into module's directory and
issuing command:

mvn clean package

The command generates RPM package "languagetool-<version>-x86_64.rpm" in
directory module's "target" directory.


RPM content
-----------

When RPM is installed for the first time, it creates user and group "ltuser".
They own all LT's files and directories. LT standalone server is also run as
"ltuser" user.

/usr/share/java/languagetool-3.9-SNAPSHOT
.........................................

LanguageTool's base directory, containing all LanguageTool JAR files and LT
server script.

/usr/share/java/languagetool-3.9-SNAPSHOT/libs/
...............................................

Directory containing most JARs LT depends on.

/usr/share/java/languagetool-3.9-SNAPSHOT/libs/standalone/
..........................................................

Directory containing standalone server-specific JARs. Together with parent
directory forms complete classpath for running standalone LT server.

/usr/share/java/languagetool-3.9-SNAPSHOT/libs/wiki/
....................................................

Directory containing LT Wiki-specific JARs. Together with parent directory
forms complete classpath for running LT Wiki addin.

/etc/languagetool/
..................

Directory containing various LT configuration files and utilities.

/etc/languagetool/lt.conf.sample
................................

Sample configuration file that is sourced by LT shell scripts. One should copy
it to "/etc/languagetool/lt.conf" and customize as needed.

/etc/languagetool/makekeystore.sh
.................................

Utility shell script that creates Java keystore with certificates required for
running standalone LT server in secure (HTTPS) mode. Input to the script is
directory containing certificates generated by Let's Encrypt website
(https://letsencrypt.org/).

/etc/languagetool/server.properties.sample
..........................................

Sample configuration file with LT standalone server options (keystore,
password etc.). It should be copied to "/etc/languagetool/server.properties" and
customized as needed.

/usr/bin/ltcmd
..............

Symbolic link to "ltshell" Bash script. Wrapper for running LT from command
line (org.languagetool.commandline.Main).

/usr/bin/ltexpdic
.................

Symbolic link to "ltshell" Bash script. Wrapper for running LT command for
exporting dictionary (org.languagetool.tools.DictionaryExporter).

/usr/bin/ltposdic
.................

Symbolic link to "ltshell" Bash script. Wrapper for running LT command for
building binary part-of-speech (POS) dictionary (org.languagetool.tools.POSDictionaryBuilder).

/usr/bin/ltspldic
.................

Symbolic link to "ltshell" Bash script. Wrapper for running LT command for
building spelling dictionary (org.languagetool.tools.SpellDictionaryBuilder).

/usr/bin/ltsyndic
.................

Symbolic link to "ltshell" Bash script. Wrapper for running LT command for
building binary synthesizer dictionary (org.languagetool.tools.SynthDictionaryBuilder).

/usr/bin/ltgui
..............

Symbolic link to "ltshell" Bash script. Wrapper for running standalone LT GUI
(org.languagetool.gui.Main).

/usr/bin/ltshell
................

Bourne-again shell script that runs various LT commands. Command that is executed
depends on symbolic link calling the script.

/usr/lib/systemd/system/languagetool.service
............................................

Systemd (https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) service file. Created
purely out of convenience, since creator of LT RPM module uses Linux distribution
that supports systemd.

/usr/share/java/languagetool-3.9-SNAPSHOT/ltserver
..................................................

Bourne-again shell script that commands LT standalone server. Invoked by LT
systemd service file.

/var/log/languagetool/
......................

Directory with LT log file(s).

/var/run/languagetool/
