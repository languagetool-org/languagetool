LanguageTool Change Log

2.3-SNAPSHOT (release planned for 2013-09-29)

 -Chinese:
  -added a workaround for a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
   (http://sourceforge.net/p/languagetool/bugs/186/)

 -the source code has been moved to github:
  https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool

 -LanguageTool requires Java 7 now

 -standalone version: remember the language selection for the next start

 -embedded server: uses default port (8081) again if started without arguments

 -Portuguese:
  -added/improved a few rules
  -it now has around 2500 compound words

 -updated the morfologik-stemming library to version 1.7.1 to enable better suggestions,
  including proper handling of diacritics and replacement patterns (equivalents of MAP
  and REP features in hunspell dictionaries)

 -some methods in the API have been deprecated

 -OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration:
  -fix: the "About" dialog didn't work in Apache OpenOffice 4.0

   many false alarms because of unknown compounds. Unfortunately, Dutch spell
   checking does not provide suggestions anymore, for performance reasons.

2.1 (2013-03-31)

 -Breton:

  -updated POS dictionary from Apertium (svn r43173)

 -Catalan:
  -added/improved several rules
  -fixed multiple false alarms
  -improved sentence and word tokenization
  -the tagger dictionary has been fixed and expanded (added 9000 nameplaces;
   115000 tagged forms from Softcatalà dictionary)
  -verbal forms have been tagged according to regional variants (with script tag_verbs.pl)
  -Hunspell dictionary (Softcatalà) has been replaced with LT tagger dictionary for spellchecking
  -spelling checker now ignores words with a POS tag (from multiwords.txt or disambiguation.xml)

 -English:
  -fixed some false alarms
  -added a few new rules
  -updated the tagger and synthesizer dictionaries to recognize more words, including
   plural forms of nouns, new verbs, and missing cardinal numerals (fixes Sourceforge
   bug #3560624)
  -updated the dictionary building script

 -Esperanto:
  -added/improved several rules
  -fixed several incorrect suggestions thanks to added tests on corrections
  -single quotes at beginning/end of word no longer cause false spelling error

 -French:
  -added/improved several rules

 -German:
  -added/improved several rules
  -The German spell checker now returns suggestions. We combine Hunspell and our own
   morfologik-based spell checker to create the suggestions for good performance,
   but they are far from perfect yet. First, some misspelled compound words fail to have
   a suggestion. Second, sometimes the best suggestion is not at the front of the list
   of suggestions.
   org/languagetool/resource/de/hunspell/create_dict.sh can be used to create
   the three morfologik spell checker dictionaries (German, Austrian, and Swiss).
  -New language variant "Simple German", with rules contributed by Annika Nietzio.
   This variant uses 'de-DE-x-simple-language' as a language code.

 -Italian:
  -added/improved a few rules

 -Malayalam:
  -now uses the default sentence tokenizer, not the English one (because languages
   are now modules that don't depend on each other)

 -Polish:
  -false alarm fixes
  -added and improved some rules
  -major tagger and synthesis dictionary update (to Morfologik 2.0 PoliMorf),
   which also fixes sf.net bug #3554018

 -Portuguese:
  -added/improved several rules
  -it now has over 1500 compound words

 -Russian:
  -several new rules
  -bugfix: the uppercase sentence rule sometimes was not triggered


 -spell checking: URLs, if specified like "http://www.foo.org", are now ignored and
  don't cause a spelling error anymore

 -API: Languagetool has been split up into several Maven modules. This causes
  some API changes:
  -No more language constants: "Language.GERMAN" now needs to be "new German()",
   similarly for all other languages
  -org.languagetool.gui.ResourceBundleWithFallback is now org.languagetool.ResourceBundleWithFallback
  -org.languagetool.gui.ContextTools is now org.languagetool.tools.ContextTools
  -LanguageIdentifierTools.ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES has been removed, languages are
   detected at runtime now

 -rule syntax: Suggestions are now also allowed outside the <message> element. Example:
    <message>Did you mean <suggestion>A</suggestion>?<message>
    <suggestion>B</suggestion>
    <suggestion>C</suggestion>
    <example type="incorrect" correction="A|B|C"><marker>asdf</marker></example>

 -bugfix: suggestions for compounds parts were missing sometimes

 -bugfix: Portuguese translation was not used

 -bugfix: fix false alarm of unpaired bracket rule on smileys :-) and ;-)
  (Sourceforge bug #3604367)

 -bugfix: testrules now report all cases when untouched examples were touched
  (Sourceforge bug #3600995)

 -bugfix: the whitespace rule now reports also combinations of non-breaking space and white space
  characters (Sourceforge bug #3608410)

 -stand-alone GUI: the very first check for languages with a lot of rules
  (e.g. German, French) should now be faster

 -embedded HTTPS server:
  -two new properties, to be set from the property configuration file,
   allow limiting the maximum number of requests:
    requestLimit - the maximum number of requests
    requestLimitPeriodInSeconds - the time period in which the requests are considered, in seconds
  -bugfix: only the first line of a POST request's body was considered

 -OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration:
  -Another try to fix the ConcurrentModificationException (Sourceforge bug #3572536)

 -Command line:
  -In verbose mode, the subId of disambiguator matched rules is displayed.

 -Testing rules:
  -Now regular expressions in disambiguation rules are heuristically tested
   (Sourceforge bug #3599002)


2.0 (2012-12-30)

 -Breton:
  -added several new rules and fixed false alarms
  -updated POS dictionary (fix wrong POS tags) from Apertium (svn r42124)
  -updated FSA spelling dictionary from An Drouizig Breton Spellchecker 0.10
  -updated classification of words tagged as plural nouns of persons
   (these have different mutation than other nouns)

 -Catalan:
  -many new rules
  -fixed false alarms
  -multiple fixes and additions in the tagger dictionary
  -Hyphen is used as a word separator, as this is very common in web pages. This way some
   ambiguities cannot be solved if the typography rule substituting hyphen for dash is disabled.
   (For example: Dir-li -ho és important.)

 -English:
  -uses the same word tokenizer again as other European languages
  -fix Sourceforge bug #3479817 (capitalization of the first item of a list not required)
  -a few rule updates

 -Esperanto:
  -few new rules

 -French:
  -updated POS tag dictionary and Hunspell dictionary to Dicollecte-4.8
  -fixed false alarms

 -German:
  -many new rules and rule updates

 -Portuguese:
  -Added hundreds of compound words
  -Added/improved several rules
  -Replaced the current dictionary with PT-pt (pre-language agreement).
   To use the post-language agreement, use the PT-br one.

 -Russian:
  -improved some rules
  -several new rules
  -updated POS dictionary (fix wrong POS Tags)

 -Spanish:
  -several new rules (thanks to Alexander Socop Arango)

 -Ukrainian:
  -updated a few rules


 -OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration:
  -Fixed ConcurrentModificationException (Sourceforge bug #3572536)

 -stand-alone GUI:
  -the tray icon menu (reachable with the right mouse button on the tray
   icon) now has a checkbox to enable the embedded HTTP server
  -the tray icon will show a small "S" symbol when the server is running
  -fixed bug "Tray icon too big sometimes" (Sourceforge #3573078)

 -API:
  -Language.getLanguageForShortName() now consistently throws an exception
   if the given language code is not known
  -Tools.median() is now private (it was accidentally made public)
  -the Java API of HTTPServer has been modified in incompatible ways. You might get
   compile errors if you have used this class from your Java code.

 -HTTP API:
  -support for auto-detecting text language (parameter autodetect=1)
  -added HTTPSServer, a lightweight embedded HTTPS server which works like HTTPServer
   but supports SSL encryption. This server supports *only* https, not http.
  -the XML we return now contains a new attribute "locqualityissuetype", which
   is the "Localization Quality Issue Type" in the upcoming Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)
   Version 2.0 standard from W3C. This means errors are now categorized according to
   a standard, additionally to LanguageTool's own categories. Useful values are only
   returned for English for now.
   *** Please consider this to be a prototypical implementation for now ***
   For the values and their meanings, please see
   http://www.w3.org/International/multilingualweb/lt/drafts/its20/its20.html#lqissue-typevalues.
   For rule developers: specify this using the new 'type' attribute. It is
   inherited from category to rulegroup, and from rulegroup to rule. If a rule also
   has the 'type' it overwrites the rulegroup's and category's 'type'.


1.9 (2012-09-30)

 -Breton:
   -several new rules and fixed false alarms
   -the internal spelling engine can now additionally tokenize words if the
    source dictionary did not include compound versions (for example,
    hyphenated words).
   -updated classification of words tagged as plural nouns of persons
    (these have different mutation than other nouns).

 -Catalan:
   -many new rules
   -fixed false alarms

 -Chinese:
   -hundreds of new Chinese rules (Tao Lin)
   -unit tests for the Chinese tokenizer and tagger

 -Danish:
   -major update to the dictionary and the rules (Henrik Bendt)

 -English:
   -fixed false alarm (sf bug #3543914)
   -some new rules and rule updates

 -Esperanto:
   -several new rules and fixed false alarms
   -updated list of transitive/intransitive verbs
   -added <url> links to REVO (Reta Vortaro) with permission from Wolfram Diestel.

 -French:
   -updated POS tag dictionary to use Dicollecte-4.6
   -several new rules and fixed false alarms
   -opening guillemet (U+00AB) followed by thin no-break
    space (U+202F) wrongly detected as error (sf bug #3545050)

 -German:
   -added simple verb/subject agreement checker
   -several new rules and rule updates
   -fixed some false alarms by upgrading to jwordsplitter 3.4 (sf bug #3475553)

 -Japanese:
   -initial support with about 20 rules (Takahiro Shinkai, Maxim Mozgovoy's student)

 -Polish:
   -fixed bug with the word repetition rule (sf bug #3560925)

 -Portuguese:
   -several rule updates (Marco A.G.Pinto)

 -Russian:
   -several new rules and rule updates
   -improve user interface translation

 -Swedish:
   -Support for Swedish has been re-enabled after it had been disabled in LanguageTool 1.7.

 -bugfix for command line: We removed XML from even plain text input. Now XML/HTML elements
  are only filtered out if the new --xmlfilter option is specified. Note that there's still
  a bug that can screw up position information with that option, thus it is deprecated.

 -command line: new option "--list" to list all available languages

 -introduced a file resources/<lang>/hunspell/ignore.txt with words that the spell checker
  will ignore

 -development: new ant target generate-ignore-files: call "ant generate-ignore-files" if you
  want to re-generate the ignore.txt files, populated with those suggestions from the grammar
  files that the spell checker would complain about.
  In other words, this makes sure "simple" suggestions (i.e. those without back references) made
  by the LanguageTool rules are never considered spelling mistakes.
  If you have downloaded the stand-alone ZIP of LanguageTool, call this command for the
  same effect:
  java -cp LanguageTool.jar org.languagetool.rules.spelling.SuggestionExtractor

 -stand-alone GUI: rules can now be disabled and re-enabled with a single click

 -stand-alone GUI: copy and paste from the result area now keeps line breaks (Sourceforge
  bug #3554842)

 -HTTP API: "+" was incorrectly removed from input (Sourceforge bug #3543914), patch by
  Sourceforge user hiddenspirit

 -HTTP API: the XML returned by the "/Languages" URL (which returns a list of all supported
  languages) has been extended to contain an 'abbrWithVariant' attribute which lists the
  language with its variant, e.g.:
  <language name="Catalan" abbr="ca" abbrWithVariant="ca-ES"/>

 -HTTP API: small internal cleanup for better exception and charset handling (always
  expects UTF-8)

 -HTTP API: the embedded HTTP server can now be started with a "--public" parameter so
  it can be accessed from anywhere (not just localhost). Please be careful with this
  option, it is not recommended for production use:
  java -cp LanguageTool.jar org.languagetool.server.HTTPServer --public

 -HTTP API and XML output: extended XML to include the version and build date
  of LanguageTool and the category and offset of each match

 -The word tokenizer now considers the following characters as a word separator: | (pipe)
  and ` (backtick).

 -bugfix: the column count was sometimes totally wrong (Sourceforge bug #3557738)


1.8 (2012-06-30)

 -Greek:
   -initial support for Greek with few rules for now (Panagiotis Minos)

 -German:
   -many new rules and rule updates
   -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version; the dictionary used is the
    one by Franz Michael Baumann,
    see http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/german-de-de-frami-dictionaries
    LanguageTool can now detect spelling errors, but it does not offer suggestions
    for performance reasons
   -added variants for Austria, Germany, and Switzerland
   -added several thousand words to the internal dictionary for better
    error detection and less false alarms

 -English:
   -several rule improvements and new rules (Scott Kuhl)
   -although a matter of debate, "an historic", "an historical", and "an habitual"
    is not considered incorrect anymore,
    also see http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a%5B2%5D
   -fixes in the tagger dictionary and disambiguation rules to reduce false alarms
   -added British and American English spelling dictionaries
   -added some rules to detect typical American expressions in British English

 -Catalan:
   -major update, including many new rules and new tokenization (Jaume Ortolà i Font)
   -new synthesizer (given a part-of-speech, this generates the inflected word
    forms) (Jaume Ortolà i Font)
   -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version
    using Hunspell dictionary ca-valencia (avl) 2.3.0 by Softcatalà

 -Russian:
   -fixed a few false alarms
   -added URL element for some rules with URL with more information about this rule
   -added spellcheck dictionary for standalone version.
   -several rule improvements (adding links, improving messages)
   -new Java rule "repeat word in sentence" (disabled by default)

 -Italian:
   -several new rules (Riccardo Murri and Agnese Dal Borgo)
   -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version

 -French:
   -updated dictionary to use Dicollecte-4.5
   -several new rules and fixed false alarms
   -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version
    using Dicollecte-4.5 «classique & réforme 1990».

 -Breton:
   -updated dictionary to use Apertium svn r38896.
   -several new rules and fixed false alarms
   -added some references to the Breton grammar:
    "La grammaire bretonne pour tous (Eugène CHALM)".
   -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version

 -Polish:
   -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version
   -some new rules and fixed false alarms
   -major update of the tagger dictionary

 -Portuguese:
   -initial support by Marco A.G. Pinto

 -Esperanto:
   -several new rules and fixed false alarms
   -added <url> for further information about errors with links to
    PMEG (Plena Manlibro de Esperanto) with permission of its
    author Bertilo Wennergren, and to http://lernu.net also with
    permission of the lernu team.
   -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version


 -LibreOffice / OpenOffice integration:
   -If a LanguageTool rule has an URL with more information, the
    grammar checking dialog in LibreOffice will now offer a "More..." link
    to that URL. That URL is also displayed on the command line and stand-alone
    user interface as "More info:", and as "url" attribute of the <error>
    element in the XML API format. This makes it possible to have external
    documentation about rules.
   -Bugfix #3526635: SingletonFactory now implements XServiceInfo (Stephan Bergmann)
   -Bugfix #3534637: Fixed false alarm about word being uppercase when the previous
    sentence ended with a footnote

 -GUI:
   -made the result of "Tag Text" a bit more readable
   -Bugfix: when LT was hidden in the tray, two very fast mouse clicks could activate
    the check twice, and that caused errors. Right now only one checking thread is active.

 -Command line:
   -In verbose mode, the log of the rule-based disambiguator actions is displayed.
   -In the profiling rules' mode on the command-line, you can now enable
    and disable rules.

 -API:
   -Deprecated some methods and the SentenceTokenizer class (SRXSentenceTokenizer
    should be used instead)

 -LanguageTool in the standalone version now supports spell-checking. Some of the languages
  use hunspell (http://hunspell.sourceforge.net), some use LanguageTool-specific code.
  There are now two distribution files: a .zip file for standalone use,
  and an .oxt extension for LibreOffice/ApacheOpenOffice. All languages supported by
  LanguageTool, except for Chinese, have spelling dictionaries bundled with the standalone
  version. Spell-checking errors appear in red in the LanguageTool standalone
  version, other errors appear in blue.

 -LanguageTool now supports separate rules for different local variants of a language,
  for example American English and British English. To use them from the command line,
  simply use "en-US" or "en-GB" as the language code. This implements sf.net feature
  suggestion #3287388.

 -The configuration file now stores settings individually for all languages. This means
  that you can enable spellcheck for American English, disable it for Polish, and British
  English, and all these settings will be saved separately.

 -If you start the HTTP Server from the GUI, it now reads the configuration files
  that are configured in the GUI (if the appropriate checkbox is set).
  This way the user can control the behavior of the server easily.

 -Two new options for the HTTP Server added: "disabled" and "enabled", which is used
  to disable or enable rules in the same way as on the command-line.

 -The XML format for rules has been changed to use <marker>...</marker> tags instead
  of mark_from and mark_to attributes.

 -Overlapping rule matches are filtered now so that only the first match per <rulegroup> is kept

 -It is now possible to suppress misspelled suggestions altogether in XML rules by applying
  an attribute suppress_misspelled="yes" on the <suggestion> element, AND on the <match>
  element. If only <match> element has this attribute set to "yes", then the suggestion is
  displayed, but no content of <match> is contained within (this might be a conditional part
  of the suggestion). Note: for this to work, the tagger dictionary needs to be fairly complete;
  words without lemmas and POS tags are considered to be misspelled.

 -Improved startup speed (Jarek Lipski)

 -Some internal bug fixing in disambiguation and pattern rules, including problems
  with unification.

 -Update of morfologik-stemming library to 1.5.3 (bug-fix release).

 -Larger tagger dictionaries were encoded in cfsa2 binary format to save space.

 -Bugfix #3054895: fixed incorrect column reported by LanguageTool in command
  line mode or with --api option when error spanned new line.

 -Bugfix #3431788: When the message contained the reference to a previous token as the first
  character, the corrections generated via regular expression replacements on match elements
  were wrong.

 -Russian:
   -fixed some false alarms
   -added several new rules
 -Ukrainian:
   -fixed a bug in the POS tagger incorrectly returning lowercase word, breaking
    the rule that checks for uppercase sentence starts (Maksym Davydov)
 -Swedish:
   -Support for Swedish has been disabled because it was not actively maintained
    for a longer time and never reached a level that the old maintainer was happy
    with. It will be activated again as soon as a new maintainer is found, any
    help is welcome!

 -bugfix: in LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org, the wrong error message was displayed
  for some rules (those that did not have a "short" message)

 -bugfix: the "fromx" position in the XML output was wrong sometimes

 -bugfix: the "contextoffset" position in the XML output was wrong
  when there were XML-escaped characters in the context

 -consecutive tab characters are not considered an error anymore

 -Ellipsis ("…") is no longer considered as a sentence separator (only relevant
  for languages not yet using SRX tokenizer).

 -new optional rule element "url" (optional): an URL to a page that explains
  the rule leading to the error in more detail. Not used yet.

 -GUI: errors are now marked with red background instead of red font
  so whitespace problems can easily be spotted

 -Server mode: by default, the server only binds to localhost now. Although requests from
  non-localhost had been denied before by default, this should be more secure.

 -Internal changes:
   - adapted to a change in Unicode handling in Java 7 that broke support for Khmer
   - added sanity check to detect duplicate exceptions in grammar rules.
   - added sanity check to detect exceptions with scope="next" yet
     without skip="..." in grammar rules.

 -Added support for Breton (Dominique Pelle)

 -English:
   -Fixed some of the problems in the Sourceforge bug #3396850 (false alarms)
 -German:
   -Extended the internal part-of-speech dictionary with
    about 2000 word forms. This should improve coverage of the
    agreement rule. It mostly affects words that have a new spelling
    after the spelling reform. See http://www.danielnaber.de/morphologie/
    for the source of the new data.
   -Several new rules
 -French:
   -Updated dictionary to use Dicollecte-4.2
   -Added and updated a few rules.  A few rules taken from
    Grammalecte-0.0.12 written by Olivier R.

   -Fast Rule Evaluation is supported in "dev.index" packag, see
    http://languagetool.wikidot.com/how-to-use-indexer-and-searcher-for-fast-rule-evaluation

 -LanguageToolGUI and LanguageTool now have support for automatic language
  detection (Michael Bryant). On the command-line, you can use -adl or
  --autoDetect to enable automatic language detection.
  Also see http://languagetool.wikidot.com/adding-a-new-language-to-automatic-language-detection

 -Internal changes:
   -The disambiguator has a new action "immunize" that protects
    token from being matched by error-detecting rules (especially
    in XML rules).
   -The disambiguator allows removing interpretations by specifying just some
    attributes with the <wd> tag.
   -Allowed three character codes for languages, e.g. 'ast' for Asturian. This
    is the ISO 639-2 code, as Asturian doesn't seem to have an ISO 639-1
    two-character code.
   -Fixed the bug with the special tag UNKNOWN: now it deals properly with
    the words at the end of sentence / paragraph.
   -Languages now initialize their classes (tokenizers, part-of-speech taggers
    etc.) lazily, i.e. only when the classes are actually needed. Improves
    startup performance a bit.
   -Switched to transifex.net for translation. Also changed our code to use the
    English string if no translation exists.

  -renamed SlovakVes to SlovakVesRule
  -renamed JLanguageTool.paragraphHandling to JLanguageTool.ParagraphHandling

  -Java rules are not loaded dynamically from the classpath anymore,
   instead every language needs to implement the getRelevantRules()
   method that returns the rule classes relevant for that language.
  -Removed jaminid dependency for HTTP Server, thanks to Ankit.
  -The HTTP server doesn't block anymore when checking a long text. It
   now has a longer startup time per call though (50-150ms).
  -Developers using LanguageTool as an API can now configure from which
   addresses the embedded HTTP server will accept requests

 -Rule development:
  -Extended testrules.sh and testrules.bat so that they can take a
   language code as argument to only check that language.
   Thanks to Michael Bryant.
   For example: sh testrules.sh en

  disambiguator. If you omit the lemma attribute and/or the token, the token and
  the lemma will be set to the matched token.

 -It is now possible to include skipped tokens from the sentence when referring
  to parts of the pattern in suggestions. Use include_skipped as attribute
  of the <match> element. To include all the tokens, including the one with the
  skip attribute set, use "all". To include only the skipped sequence, use "following"
  as the value of include_skipped. To include nothing, use "none".

 -The syntax used for unification was slightly modified to make it more XML-friendly.
  The details are to be found on the wiki at

0.9.9 (2009-05-22)

 -Added preliminary support for Icelandic thanks to Anton
  Karl Ingason

 -More English, Dutch, Polish and Romanian grammar rules.
  More English/Polish false friends. Improvements to Russian
  rules.

 -Fixed some bugs with pairing brackets. Now the rule also
  complains about balanced parentheses put in the wrong
  order (like ")abc("), or overlapped with other symbols (like
  'his "mother'") and in all places the symbols weren't
  found to be balanced.

 -Added sentence tokenizer that uses SRX format for
  specifying end-of-sentence breaks (for specification, see
  http://www.lisa.org/fileadmin/standards/srx20.html). This
  enhanced the quality and speed of sentence tokenization
  (for example, tokenizing the whole Brown corpus in the old
  tokenizer took 572613ms, while it takes 125971ms right now).
  Currently, English, Polish, Romanian and Dutch are using
  SRX segmentation rules.

 -Added Dutch (Belgium) as a country variant to support it
  in OpenOffice.org.

 -Updated Russian translation (Yakov Reztsov)

 -Updated Slovenian translation and added more rules
  for this language (Martin Srebotnjak)

 -Updated Slovak translation and added Slovak sentence
  tokenizer (Zdenko Podobný).

  paragraph-level rules (SF bug # 2787814), removed bugs that lead to false positives
  in some English rules. Some code cleanup.

 -Fixed a bug that truncated the suggested replacements for false
  friends.

 -Translation of messages into Slovak by Zdenko Podobný

 -Small fixes and additions for Polish and English. Small dictionary
  update for English.

 -Now sentences written in different languages in OpenOffice.org
  are recognized as such and checked properly (previously it was
  assumed that the whole paragraph has always the same language).

 -New mode of operation on command-line: you can apply suggestions
  automatically by supplying "--apply" switch (or "-a" for short).
  LanguageTool will then output a text with suggestions applied,
  while suppressing all other text (you can, however, still get
  verbose output on STDERR). This way LanguageTool may be used to
  automatically edit a text (to clean a corpus before some other
  operations, for example).  Note: only the first suggestion is
  applied in the automatic mode, so make sure that the first
  suggestion is the best one.

 -The command-line tool works now with STDIN. STDIN is activated
  anytime a filename is not specified or if you specified "-"
  explicitly.

 -Update of morfologik-stemming library to version 1.1.4
  fixes a NullPointerException (sf bug #2613574) and some
  problems with UTF-8 dictionaries.

 -Now it's possible to test disambiguation XML rules in a similar
  manner that error-matching rules are tested. Look in English
  disambiguation rules for examples (at the end of the file).

 -Taggers recognize now mistyped lowercase words that should be
  uppercase.

 -Fixed a bug that disallowed using rules that were turned off by
  default.

 -Added more tests and fixed some position errors in the XML rules and
  disambiguation rules.

 -Fixed some glitches with line numbers, time statistics and
  match numbers, and unknown words when checking large files
  on the command line. Fixed a bug with case conversion in rules
  that contained element <match> in suggestions and numerical
  references such as \1 in the message.


0.9.7 (2009-03-03)

 -Small updates to Polish disambiguation rules, German
  error rules, and English dictionary

  in OpenOffice.org, for example French.

0.9.6 (2009-01-21)

 -Support for new Proofreading API in OpenOffice 3.0.1. The
  non-native dialog box used for checking the text in LT was
  removed as it duplicated the native function and was buggy
  (see for example sf bug #1943695).

 -The toolbar button became redundant and was removed. A new
  menu command "Recheck document" was added to start a new check
  and reset the rules set as ignored during the previous check
  (the rules disabled in the configuration dialog are not
  enabled on recheck).

 -Added possibility to specify feature unification (introduced
  in XML files but the implemented mechanism is general).

 -Added new features to the rule disambiguator, such as unification,
  filtering, deleting and adding interpretations. Fixed some
  small bugs.

 -Added a tagger dictionary for Russian (thanks to Yakov).

 -Added compounds rule for English and Polish, and made the
  existing compound rule easily extensible for new languages.

 -Added possibility to add shorter comments for rules to be
  displayed in OpenOffice.org 3.x context menus.

 -New command-line option -t or --taggeronly can be used to
  tag a text file with POS tags and lemmas as seen by LanguageTool.
  This means that you can use LanguageTool as a standalone
  tagger for testing or for building a corpus.

 -The rule that checks for whitespace surrounding punctuation
  marks now detects an orphaned full stop as requested by OOo
  users (http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=93931).

 -Added a possibility to check if there is a whitespace before a
  token in XML rules (simply specify attribute spacebefore="yes";
  possible values are also "no" and "ignore". "ignore" is the
  default.)

 -Added new English, Dutch, Polish and Russian rules. Fixed false
  alarms for many English rules (including 'a vs. an' rule) based
  on the community.languagetool.org user votes and sourceforge.net
  tracker reports (#2319686, #2319670, #2381522). Fixed false
  alarms for many Dutch (thanks to R.J. Baars) and Polish rules.

 -Massive corrections and additions to the English tagger lexicon. Added
  a lot of new disambiguation rules for English.

 -Massive corrections to the Dutch tagger and synthesizer lexicon (thanks
  to R.J. Baars).

 -Corrections to the Polish tagger and synthesizer lexicon. Added
  rule-based disambiguator for Polish.

  the validity of XML files, including false friends, rules and
  disambiguator rules.

 -Fixed problems with uppercase sentence start rule with lists for Russian
  and Polish (thanks to Yakov Reztsov).

 -Fixed a bug in synthesizer suggestions generated for indeterminate
  articles before compound words (such as 'all-inclusive').

 -Fixed a bug that could cause errors in XML error/disambiguation rule
  matching.

 -Fixed a bug that could cripple case conversion of tokens matched in
  suggestions formatted with regular expressions.

 -Fixed a bug that resulted from missing synchronization of code used
  for doing actual grammar-check in OpenOffice.org (see sf bugs #2416655,
  #2411768, #2379365).

 -Fixed other small bugs (rule numbering in text output; archaic words
  offered in some English suggestions; ignoring some exceptions that
  were set for preceding tokens; incorrect positions of errors on some
  tagged punctuation tokens; incorrect formatting of some synthesized
  suggestions; ignoring manual hyphenation marks during checking in
  OpenOffice.org; not printing unknown words on command-line).

0.9.5 (2008-11-02)

 -Fixed a bug in whitespace rule that caused LT to crash
  OpenOffice.org with English text.

 -Fixed a bug that caused some languages to be wrongly
  tagged in Turkish Unicode locale (reported by Serkan Kaba).

  caused LT not to break the sentence at all.

0.9.4 (2008-09-30)

 -Fixed freezing on startup with OpenOffice.org 3.0.

  and grammar rules (thanks to Camille Moulin).

 -Added abbreviations for Russian sentence tokenizer and
  Russian compound rule. Updated Russian rules (thanks
  to Yakov Reztsov).

 -LanguageTool button in OpenOffice.org is now placed next to
  the "Spelling and Grammar" button.

 -It is now possible to turn the whole category of rules
  by default off (in the XML file).


0.9.3 (2008-08-06)

 -Works with OpenOffice.org 3.0 beta m26 or later.
  LanguageTool.jar needed to be removed from classpath.
  Added support for the new grammar checking API (displays
  blue wavy lines for errors automatically, a context
  menu with suggestions, rechecks document when options
  changed...). With the new API, it is possible to check
  documents with multiple languages. When using the blue
  wavy lines, all known previous bugs with OpenOffice.org
  were solved; note that OpenOffice.org 3.0 "Spell and Grammar
  Check" dialog is *not* completely implemented yet.
  Sometimes you need to use our slightly buggy dialog instead
  (progress dialog is always on top to solve focus problems).

 -Added full support for various Unicode whitespace
  characters as word separators (including typographic
  space characters).

 -Added support for Russian (thanks to Yakov Reztsov).

 -Fixed the bug that caused that "&" was shown in buttons,
  and not interpreted as shortcut.

 -Fixed menu and toolbar icon which were broken
  during compilation (black square or empty).

 -Fixed a small bug with formatting some case-sensitive
  suggestions.

 -Added a generic rule that detects redundant whitespace.

 -Added Dutch synthesizer for making suggestions based
  on part-of-speech changes.

 -Added a rule-based disambiguator for English to minimize
  false alarms.

 -New Dutch, English (dealing with agreement and redundancy),
  Polish and Swedish rules. Added more false friends. Removed
  some false alarms.

 -The German tagger now splits compounds words correctly which
  avoids several mistaggings and thus false alarms.

 -Added new Swedish tagger for more complex rules, thanks to
  Niklas Johansson.

 -The command line client now prints a number after the
  rule id so you can see which of the rules in a rule group
  it refers to, for example:
  "2.) Line 1, column 43, Rule ID: MUEHLHEIM_A_D_RUHR[1]"

0.9.2 (2008-02-17)

 -LanguageTool is now part of the "Tools" menu in
  OpenOffice.org and its toolbar button is docked to
  standard toolbar by default.

 -LanuageTool's OpenOffice.org configuration is now saved
  in the user's home directory.

 -Added preliminary support for Swedish (thanks to Niklas
  Johansson).

 -More false friends, especially Polish-English, and
  generalization of existing false friend rules for English
  and German.

 -Added possibility to display a false friend list as
  a dictionary formatted in HTML (rules/print-ff.xsl).

 -Added an attribute to the DTD so XML rules and groups
  of rules can be disabled by default by specifying
  default="off". Java rules can be set as turned off by
  default by using setDefaultOff() method.
  Both settings can be overridden in the Options dialog
  box.

 -Added possibility to set hot keys for UI items in
  translation. Corrected French translation (thanks to
  Hugo Voisard).

 -Fixed bug in OOo extension that caused that false friend
  rules did not display in the configuration dialog.

 -Added the possibility to disable complete rule groups
  (categories) in the GUI.

 -Fixed some Polish rules. Added more Dutch rules and several
  hundred more French rules.

 -XML rules: added possibility to refer to matched tokens'
  POS in <match> elements inside <token>. This is useful
  for defining agreement without combinatorial explosion.

 -OOo extension will be distributed in .oxt format that
  allows automatic updates.

 -Internal change: updated tagger library and streamlined
  some tagger code.

0.9.1 (2007-09-17)

 -Fixed a bug with the resource paths that was discovered
  in OpenOffice.org 2.3 and that made it impossible to use
  LanguageTool with OpenOffice.org 2.3.

 -XML rules: enabled referring to whole phrases in suggestions, and
  changing their POS tags appropriately. Added support for attribute
  scope="previous" in exceptions.

 -Fixed error marking problems for XML rules that use phrases
  and skipping.

 -Added and tweaked some Polish and English rules.

 -Fixed problems with badly written XML rules that used skipping.

 -LanguageTool now requires Java 6.0 to be compiled, but it
  still runs with Java 5.0.

 -The icon in the system tray now offers a menu when clicking
  the right mouse button (Java 6.0 only).

 -Several people had problems with the LanguageTool dialog
  appearing in the background (when using LanguageTool inside
  OpenOffice.org). A workaround has been added that tries
  to fix this problem.

 -The embedded webserver can now work with UTF-8. Input must
  now always be in UTF-8 (or 7-Bit ASCII, as that is a subset of
  UTF-8).

 -Fixed bug (#1726044 in sf.net tracking system) concerning the
  Italian tagger dictionary that resulted in a badly formatted
  dictionary file.

 -The stand-alone LanguageTool can now load an XML rule file using
  the new menu item "Add language...". This way people can write
  rules and use without touching any Java code and without the need
  for the rule file to be distributed with LanguageTool.
  Currently, the file must be named in the format "rules-xx-name.xml",
  where "xx" is the two-character language code and "name" is the full
  name of the language in English. Example: rules-en-English.xml
  TODO: needs more polishing: i18n, store and load configuration, add
  the same to OOo

0.9 (2007-05-20)

 -It's possible to edit rules using XML Mind XML Editor (xxe) in a
  WYSYWIM (what you see is what you mean) mode. Simply open the file
  in xxe, and it should display in a form input mode. It is recommended
  that you uncheck Options > Preferences > Save > Add open lines. Set
  a high value in Max line length.

 -Now you can simply open rule files (rules/<language>/grammar.xml) with
  Firefox to see examples of errors and descriptions of rules in a
  human-readable format.

 -A lot of new French rules by Agnes Souque (mostly grammar errors) and
  Hugo Voisard (mostly stylistic errors).

 -Everyone can now develop, modify, and test grammar rules without requiring
  the LanguageTool source code. Just call this command, it will run all
  tests in all grammar.xml files (tests are the sentences in the
  <example>...</example> tags). If you work in Linux, type:
  sh testrules.sh
  In Windows command line, type:
  testrules.bat

 -German compound nouns are now split so that also compound words
  which are not in the dictionary are recognized. This way more
  agreement errors can be detected, e.g. "die Donaudampfschiff".
  The dictionary for jWordSplitter was created using the new class
  ExportGermanNouns.

 -New option -u or --list-unknown for the command line version: lists
  all words that are not known, i.e., words without POS information.
  This currently also lists words written with an uppercase first
  letter unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence.

 -Added support for variables in XML pattern rules and disambiguation
  rules; it is now possible to refer to previously matched tokens using
  <match> element.

 -Added support for logical AND operation for combining tokens
  in error pattern and disambiguation rules (XML-based). In other
  words, all possible logical combinations are now available in
  the rule declaration.

 -Added support for XML-based rule disambiguation of POS tags
  (based on an idea by Agnes Souque).

 -Added support for regular expressions and POS tags to
  create complex suggestions (for example, suggesting another
  grammatical case or a word without an apostrophe). Suggestions
  based on selecting POS tags require a special synthesis dictionary,
  compiled for the language. Currently, two such dictionaries are
  available: for English and Polish.

 -Added initial support for Slovenian (Martin Srebotnjak)

 -Fixed and refined some faulty suggestions for Polish, English, and
  Spanish rules.

 -Added special POS tag value "UNKNOWN" that matches any token without
  any part of speech token. Useful for matching proper names
  or misspelled words that are not in the dictionary.

 -The tray icon should now also work on the Mac.

 -Added option to test suggested replacements in internal quality
  tests.

 -Refined and added more Polish and English rules with new suggestion
  features.

 -Fixed bug with saving preference for mother tongue (for false
  friend checking) in the stand-alone GUI and OOo extension.

 -Fixed bug for users that have Windows username with special
  characters; OpenOffice.org extension can now read its files
  correctly.

 -Internal change: changed source directory structure; now files
  are accessed based on the classpath and not file structure
  (more portable way).

0.8.9 (2007-04-07)

 -Security: The embedded webserver didn't escape HTML when an error
  message was returned which led to the possibility to inject
  Javascript via cross site scripting (thanks to "sumit")

 -A lot of new Polish rules

 -Improved German rules to give less false alarms

 -Improved English rules

 -Added initial support for Czech (by Jozef Licko)

 -Added initial support for Ukrainian (by Andriy Rysin)

 -Make OpenOffice.org integration work with NeoOffice (by Ray Hazlip)

 -Enabled use of much more compact dictionaries for languages with
  heavy use of infixes or prefixes (mostly Slavic languages).

 -Fixed a bug with suggestions for some rules that match correlated
  words in the sentence, and a bug with matching in some of them.

 -New UnpairedQuotesBracketsRule (for pairing (), [], {}, „”, »«,
  depending on the language); works on a paragraph-level. Additionally,
  new mechanisms for paragraph- and text-level rules were introduced.

 -New French punctuation rule for inserting a non-breakable
  space before '!', '?', ':', and ';' and after or before
  French quotation marks ('«' and '»').

 -Fixed crash when started in an unsupported locale

 -Added support for declaring phrases (or chunks) in rules,
  which allows reusing same structures in various rules. This
  could be thought of as simplified chunking.

 -The command line version (LanguageTool.jar) can now be started
  from any directory. In previous versions, you had to be in the
  LanguageTool installation directory to start it.

 -Internal change: rules are loaded dynamically to make adding
  a new language easier in the future (patch by Andriy Rysin)

0.8.8 (2007-01-30)

 -XML output of HTTP interface changed for compatibility with
  An Gramadoir (http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/), see
  resource/api-output.dtd for the new format. Fixed some encoding
  problems with the HTTP response.

 -Added --api option to Main method so the XML output can be tested
  on the command line.

 -Improved English, Dutch and Polish rules

 -Fixed several false alarms in German agreement rule (e.g., for "Dies liegt
  aller Kommunikation zugrunde." and "Der Vorgang, der soziale Akteure
  miteinander verknüpft.")

 -Improved German coherency rule, e.g. using "Ketchups" and "Ketschups"
  in one document will lead to an error

 -German part-of-speech information can now be added to resource/de/added.txt

 -Slightly improved suggestions of German compound rule, e.g., "x mal"
  will suggest "x-mal", not "xmal"

 -Fixed false alarm in German "wieder vs. wider" rule

 -Command line version now stops with error message if unknown options
  are used

0.8.7 (2006-12-31)

 -Extended and improved English, Polish, and Dutch rules

 -Added some Lithuanian rules (Thanks to Mantas Kriaučiūnas)

 -Improved UppercaseSentenceStartRule for sentences that start with a
  quote character

 -Bugfix: Small fixes for German compound rule (e.g., "New Yorker" and
  "New-Yorker" are both okay)

 -Bugfix: Don't crash but show error if LanguageTool is used with Java <= 1.4
  inside OpenOffice.org

 -Bugfix: LanguageTool stopped with a MissingResourceException when started
  in a locale that's not supported (e.g., fr_CA = French, Canada)

 -Added French translation of the GUI (Thanks to Hugo Voisard)

0.8.6 (2006-12-17)

 -Added support for Dutch (Thanks to Ruud J. Baars)

 -Added initial support for Lithuanian (no XML rules yet)

 -Error rules slightly improved for English, German, and Polish

 -Small improvements to the sentence tokenizer

 -Command line version and stand-alone version now print suggested fixes

 -New rule for German that complains about the spelling of compound words
  that are written as separate words, e.g., for "System Administrator"
  LanguageTool suggests "System-Administrator" and "Systemadministrator".
  See resource/de/compounds.txt for a list of words that this rule detects.

 -OpenOffice.org integration:
    -fixed that some errors messages (e.g., Language not supported) could freeze
     the OpenOffice.org GUI
    -the "server mode" configuration is now only available in a stand-alone
     mode, as it doesn't make sense inside OpenOffice.org
    -configuration dialog is now mostly translated
    -error marking corrected for documents that contain index markers
    -improved icon

 -Stand-alone GUI:
    -improved tray icon
    -added shortcuts for its menu items
    -new menu item "Check Text in Clipboard"
    -will now hide itself to the system tray when
     clicking the window close button when started in system tray mode
     (with -t or --tray). Use "Quit" from the menu to exit the program
     completely.
    -user interface is now mostly translated

 -Debugging output (-v) of German texts has been improved, it now shows the
  part-of-speech tags as they are used during rule matching

0.8.5 (2006-10-30)

 -Fixed small bugs connected with special HTML characters used
  internally and entities encoding

 -OpenOffice.org integration: documents > 64K can now be checked
  WARNING: There's still a problem with documents that contain tables,
  the wrong part of the text will be selected.

 -OpenOffice.org integration: progress dialog now really shows the progress

 -Introduced new POS tags for uncountable nouns (NN:U) and for nouns
  that can be used as uncountable (NN:UN). Added most common proper names
  to the English tagger dictionary.

 -LanguageTool can now run as a server that returns its results
  in a simple XML format via HTTP. Activate the server using
  "File -> Options..." or start it via command line using
  java -cp jaminid.jar:LanguageTool.jar de.danielnaber.languagetool.server.HTTPServer

 -By default, a single linebreak is not supposed to be a paragraph
  delimiter anymore (this was introduced in 0.8.4). With the command
  line application, you can use the new option -b to make LanguageTool
  take single linebreaks as paragraphs delimiters again. Two consecutive
  linebreaks are always considered a paragraph boundary (and thus a
  sentence boundary).

 -Added initial French, Spanish and Italian support

 -Added new rules for English and Polish

0.8.4 (2006-08-20)

 -Added several new rules for English, German, and Polish

 -The false friend rules now offer a possible correction

 -Stand-alone GUI: the program can now be docked to the system tray.
  Selecting any text and clicking on the icon in the system tray pops up
  the main window and checks the selected text. You need to unzip
  standalone-libs.zip for this feature to work (this was necessary so
  OpenOffice.org, which works on the same ZIP, doesn't get confused).

 -Stand-alone GUI: now stores its configuration to a file ".languagetool.cfg"
  in the user's home directory. Still buggy, as it only stores the configuration
  for one text language.

 -OpenOffice.org integration: cursor doesn't jump to start anymore before it
  selects the error

 -OpenOffice.org integration: LanguageTool's suggestions can now be accepted
  using a double click

 -A single line break in texts will now be interpreted as the end of a
  paragraph thus also as the end of a sentence.

 -Reduced size of LanguageTool by using a more compact
  part-of-speech tagger

 -Changed DTD to support more XML-like rule encoding, added categories

 -Extended exception matching to multiple tokens, added more flexible ways
  to match variable word order languages (via skipping tokens in rules)

 -Added lemmatization support, regular expression support

 -Added AnalyzedTokenReadings class to support multiple readings
  in all taggers, changed the code appropriately

 -Some API changes

0.8.3 (2006-06-25)

 -Requires Java 1.5 now

 -Support for Polish (Marcin Milkowski)

 -Fixed a NullPointerException in DoublePunctuationRule

 -Added information to the README about how to compile LanguageTool for
  .NET using IKVM

 -OpenOffice.org: The selection of the potentially incorrect text was wrong
  after paragraphs (on Windows only)

0.8.2 (2006-02-26)

 -New menu entry "Configuration..."

 -If you're a native speaker of German and write a text in English, LanguageTool
  can now warn you if you're using a "false friend", i.e., an English word that sounds
  like a German word but has a different meaning (e.g., become <-> bekommen).
  This also works vice versa (i.e., English native speakers will get a warning
  when writing a German text using a false friend).

 -Added a few new pattern rules

 -Missing whitespace after a comma is now detected

 -Added a new German rule that detects missing agreement in e.g.,
  "meine Auto" (correct: "mein Auto"). This also introduces some new
  false alarms.

 -Errors for German text are now displayed in German

 -Several other small fixes

 -Only relevant for developers: changes to rules.dtd (affect "lang" attribute)

 -Only relevant for developers: XML validation doesn't happen at runtime
  anymore but only when "ant test" is called

0.8.1 (2005-12-22)

 -Made it work for cases where the add-on installation path contains
  spaces (often seems to be the case under Windows)

 -Added a few rules for English

 -Added more exceptions so the English "a vs. an" rule works better

 -Other small fixes

0.8 (2005-12-17)

 -Added OpenOffice.org integration. Install the LanguageTool ZIP via
  Tools -> Package Manager -> Add..., re-start OpenOffice.org and you'll
  have a new menu item "LanguageTool" which checks your text.

 -The German data is now more compact (but still 40MB when uncompressed)
  and it's included in the standard distribution

 -Fixed morphology data for a few German words

 -Added some new simple pattern rules for English and German

 -Switched to new English part-of-speech data and new version of
  part-of-speech tagger (OpenNLP-tools 1.3)

 -Files are called LanguageTool instead of JLanguageTool again
  as the Java version is the only maintained version anyway

0.7.2 (2005-11-21)

 -several new pattern rules for typical German and English typos

 -new rule that checks for ".." and ",,"

 -new CaseRule for German text: complains if non-nouns are written
  in uppercase and checks uppercase spelling of "substantivierte Verben",
  e.g., "Das Laufen fällt mir leicht."

 -extension of pattern synatx: DT^foo|bar will match words tagged
  as "DT", except the word is "foo" or "bar"

 -fixed several false alarms (i.e., rules matching text which is
  actually correct)

 -fixed error marking for matches of pattern rules

 -fixed morphology data for these German words: Papagei, Virus, Stasi

0.7.1 (2005-09-08)

 -Rules can now be enabled/disabled in GUI

 -the error displayed to the user is now taken from the "message"
  element, not from the "name" attribute anymore

 -implemented mark_from and mark_to attributes, these can
  be used to expand/shrink the area of text that is marked
  as wrong. Both attributes default to 0 so that the text
  marked as wrong is exactly the one that matches the pattern.

 -back references like \1 can now be used in error messages
  to refer to the parts of the original text that is matched
  by the pattern

 -a few German noun phrases like "der große Mann" are now checked
  for agreement. For example, "des großer Mannes" is detected
  as incorrect. This requires data in rules/de/categories which needs
  to be downloaded separately.

 -a new rule checks whether a sentence starts with an uppercase letter

0.7 (2005-08-15)

 -first release of Java rewrite
