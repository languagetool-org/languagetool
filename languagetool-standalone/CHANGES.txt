LanguageTool Change Log

2.5 (2014-03-31)

-Breton:
    -a new rule checks that there is a space character between sentences
    
-Catalan:
    -added/improved many rules
    -fixed false alarms
    -added hundreds of suggestions for barbarisms in a simple replace rule

-Dutch:
    -remove a hack from the word tokenizer code
    -several new false friends (by Sander van Geloven)

-English:
    -added a new rule to handle corrections of mistakes in standard
     English contractions (wasnt, didnt)
    -changed word tokenization so that the hyphen at the end of a
     word is no longer its part
    -removed spelling replacement pairs that made LT work very slowly
    -fixed a large number of false alarms
    -added new rules to handle common contextual misspellings and
     redundant phrases as well as common grammatical mistakes. Now
     the number of rules for English exceeds 1000.
    -made it possible to use synthesizer to both add a determiner and
     make different replacement operations when creating suggestions;
     simply add \\+INDT or \\+DT as special keywords to the regex that
     creates the POS tag in the match element
    -a new rule checks that there is a space character between sentences

-Esperanto:
    -added/improved several rules
    -a new rule checks that there is a space character between sentences

-French:
    -updated POS tag dictionary and Hunspell dictionary to Dicollecte-5.0.2
    -added/improved several rules
    -a new rule checks that there is a space character between sentences

-German:
    -fixed several false alarms
    -added/improved several rules
    -a new rule checks that there is a space character between sentences

-Japanese:
    -added some rules (thanks to Silvan Jegen)

-Polish:
    -updated POS tag dictionary to PoliMorfologik 2.1
    -cleaned up spelling rules and hyphenation rules, added some frequent
     misspellings to generate proper suggestions
    -added simple compounding support for compound words containing prefixes
     such as "anty" or "mini", and adjectives with numerals such as "trzynasto"
    -removed annoying false alarms
    -added a number of new rules
    -changed word tokenization so that the hyphen at the end of a
     word is no longer its part; multi-word expressions with a hyphen
     are also split into their component parts to avoid many false
     alarms in spell-checking
    -a new rule checks that there is a space character between sentences
     
-Portuguese:
    -added/improved several rules
    -added dozens of compounds: it now has 3400+ compound words
    -a new rule checks that there is a space character between sentences
    
-Russian:
    -added a few rules
    -added some new rules, thanks to Julia Semenenko from WebSpellChecker.net
    -added many false friends rules (Russian/English)
    -updated POS tag dictionary and synthesizer dictionary from AOT.ru(Seman) rev. 242
    -added frequency information for spell-checking dictionary from AOT.ru(Seman)
    
-Slovenian:
    -fixed sentence detection so that sentences that begin with a lowercase
     character can now be detected
    
-added common punctuation and mathematical characters (=#*∗×·+÷) to the 
 set of tokenizing characters in most languages

-added new element <unify-ignore/> in XML rules to mark the parts of the unified
 sequence that are not checked (useful to ignore punctuation, connectives, or not
 inflected words)

-added new element <antipattern> (which can include <token>, <and>, <unify>, and <marker>),
 useful for marking complex multiword exceptions in rules and rulegroups (a single
 antipattern can be shared by multiple rules in the same group)

-spell checking:
    -Immunized tokens are now ignored and don't cause a spelling error anymore;
     one can also add particular contextual expressions to ignored words by using
     a new action of the disambiguator: "ignore_spelling".
    -The words in ignore.txt are checked using case conversions allowed in the
     speller dictionary (in MorfologikSpeller-based dictionaries).
     This usually means that the word added in lowercase will be accepted
     also when it is found at the beginning of the sentence; but if it is added in
     uppercase, it won't be accepted when written in lowercase.
    -updated Morfologik libraries to 1.9.0 to speed up suggestion generation in spell
     checks, not only when using replacement pairs but also for ignoring diacritics.

-stand-alone GUI:
    -The "More..." dialog now contains a link to community.languagetool.org
     with details about the matching rule

-API:
    -incompatible change: changed the return type of Rule.getLocQualityIssueType()
     from String to ITSIssueType
    -incompatible change: changed the parameter of Rule.setLocQualityIssueType()
     from String to ITSIssueType
    -deprecated Rule.isSpellingRule(), please use Rule.isDictionaryBasedSpellingRule()
     instead
 
 
2.4.1 (2014-01-08)

	-added frequency information for spell-checking dictionary; 
	 frequency wordlist comes from the Gaia project, with Apache License, 
	 version 2.0
	 (https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/keyboard/dictionaries).
	-fixed some false alarms

-Portuguese:
	-added/improved several rules (it now includes gender rules "a"/"o")
	-it now has 3400+ compound words

-the JAR file has been renamed to languagetool.jar, from formerly
 languagetool-standalone.jar to avoid confusion about what 'standalone'
 means in this context (github issue #29)

-for languages with many rules (like French or German) performance
 on long texts has been increased by about 20-30%

-fix for thread-safety (could cause hang in MultiWordChunker)

-fixed a bug where chunk annotations were not tested in <and> groups

 interpretations prematurely

-added support for chunk annotations in the disambiguator, and fixed one bug
 in filtering tokens with chunk annotations

-updated Morfologik libraries to 1.8.2 (bug fixes, stricter input sanity checking,
 add frequency data to dictionaries)

-added the option of including frequency data to tagging or spelling dictionaries. 
 The expected format of the frequency wordlists is the one in the Gaia 
 project, with Apache License, version 2.0
 (https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/gaia/tree/master/keyboard/dictionaries)

-new command line tools to export and create binary dictionaries:
	org.languagetool.dev.DictionaryExporter
	org.languagetool.dev.POSDictionaryBuilder

-LibreOffice/OpenOffice integration:
	-added a workaround for incorrect sentence detection for the case that a
	 footnote appeared after a sentence full stop (Sourceforge bug #191) 

-stand-alone GUI:
	-The dialog opened by the "More..." item in the context menu of an error
	 will now also display correct and incorrect example sentences
	 
-API:
	-SentenceTokenizer is now an interface, the implementation has been moved to
	 RegexSentenceTokenizer, but this is deprecated and SRXSentenceTokenizer
	 should be used instead
	-Some methods from org.languagetool.tools.StringTools have been moved to
	 the org.languagetool.gui.Tools class in the languagetool-gui-commons project
	-LanguageToolListener.languageToolEventOccured() has been renamed to
	 LanguageToolListener.languageToolEventOccurred()
	-org.languagetool.tools.SymbolLocator isn't public anymore (shouldn't affect anybody)
	-removed DanishSentenceTokenizer which had been deprecated for three years
	-Rule.getCorrectExamples() and Rule.getIncorrectExamples() don't return null anymore
	 but an empty list if there are no examples. Consequently, setCorrectExamples() and
	 setIncorrectExamples() don't accept null anymore.
	-Rule.getId() may return any string now, not just ASCII-only strings (actually this
	 has been the case before, as the ASCII-only restriction was never enforced and only
	 mentioned in the javadoc)

-languagetool-wikipedia: the command line options for checking a Wikipedia dump
 have been simplified. The command can now be called like this:
 java -jar languagetool-wikipedia.jar check-data -l en -f enwiki-20130621-pages-articles.xml
 Call just "java -jar languagetool-wikipedia.jar check-data" to get a usage message.
 More than one file can be specified with the -f option. Additionally to Wikipedia
 XML dumps, CSV files from Tatoeba (http://tatoeba.org) are now also supported,
 they need to be filtered first to contain only the relevant language.


2.3.1 (2013-10-07, released on Maven Central only)

	-fixes for thread-safety


2.3 (2013-09-30)

-Breton:
	-added/improved a few rules
	-fixed false alarms
	-updated POS dictionary from Apertium (svn r47282)

-Catalan:
	-added support for language code ca-ES-valencia (Catalan Valencian),
	 to be used in LibreOffice 4.2.0
	-added a simple replace rule with hundreds of replacement suggestions
	-added/improved several rules
	-fixed false alarms

-Chinese:
	-added a workaround for a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
	 (http://sourceforge.net/p/languagetool/bugs/186/)

-English:
	-added replacement patterns for the spelling checker to make suggestions
	 better (now offers 'taught' for 'teached')
	-added/improved a few rules

-French:
	-added/improved a few rules
	-fixed false alarms
	-updated POS tag dictionary and Hunspell dictionary to Dicollecte-4.12

-German:
	-added/improved several rules

-Portuguese:
	-added/improved a few rules
	-it now has 3300+ compound words

-Ukrainian:
	-added/improved several rules


-the source code has been moved to github:
	https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool

-LanguageTool requires Java 7 now

-LanguageTool makes use of multiple threads now for text checking on modern
	hardware, improving performance (this affects the stand-alone version, the
	command line version and the LibreOffice/OpenOffice extension)

-Rule syntax:
	-preliminary support for new min/max attributes that allow to match an
	 element that appears the given number of times. For example:
		<token min="0">foo</token> will match nothing or "foo", i.e. "foo" is optional
		<token max="2">foo</token> will match "foo" or "foo foo"
		<token min="0" max="2">foo</token> will match nothing, "foo", or "foo foo"
	 Use max="-1" to allow unlimited occurrences.
	 For min, only 0 or 1 is supported (1 is the default).
	-support for OR-statements. For example:
		<or>
			<token>a</token>
			<token postag="V"/>
		</or>
	 Internally and in run-time, a rule containing OR-statements is converted into
	 several rules without OR-statements.

-English now has a chunker to detect, amongst others, singular and plural noun chunks.
	This is documented at http://wiki.languagetool.org/using-chunks

-standalone version:
	-The standalone version now underlines errors with a red (spelling errors) or
	 blue (other errors) line (Panagiotis Minos)
	-Remember the language selection for the next start
	-Improved window and dialog placement in a multi-monitor setup

-embedded server: uses default port (8081) again if started without arguments

-updated the morfologik-stemming library to version 1.7.1 to enable better suggestions,
	including proper handling of diacritics and replacement patterns (equivalents of MAP
	and REP features in hunspell dictionaries)

-OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration:
	-fix: the "About" dialog didn't work in Apache OpenOffice 4.0
	-fix: country specific rules (like for British English) didn't work

-API:
	-In class Language, getCountryVariants() has been renamed to getCountries(), and a new method
	 getVariant has been added.
	-Some methods have been deprecated
	-Some methods have been moved from the Tools class (languagetool-core) to the
	 new CommandLineTools class (languagetool-commandline)
	-AbstractRuleDisambiguator has been renamed XmlRuleDisambiguator and is not abstract anymore.
	 The <Language>RuleDisambiguator classes have been removed, XmlRuleDisambiguator can be
	 used directly instead.
	-A new method JLanguageTool.check(AnnotatedText) has been introduced that allows
	 you to check text with markup. Use AnnotatedTextBuilder to build up the input.
	-Thread-safety has been improved. The recommended use case is now to
	 create a new JLanguageTool object for each thread, but to create the
	 language only once (e.g. new English()) and use that for all JLanguageTool
	 instances. This changed the API of some public classes, but for the standard
	 use case of checking texts with the JLanguageTool object it shouldn't make a
	 difference. (patch by Stefan Lotties)
	-JLanguageTool.loadFalseFriendRules() now behaves like JLanguageTool.loadPatternRules():
	 it looks in the class path first, and then, if the given file is not found there, in
	 the filesystem
	-Introduced the Chunker interface that can assign chunks (also known as phrases)
	 to tokens. For example, for noun phrases like "a fast computer" the chunker could assign
	 an 'NP-singular' (noun phrase, singular) chunk to each of the tokens in that phrase.
	 In the grammar.xml, such a token can then be matched with this syntax:
	 <token chunk="NP-singular"></token>
	-The new class MultiThreadedJLanguageTool makes use of as many threads
	 as the computer has processors. In our tests this has improved text checking
	 time by about 70% on an Intel i7 processor when used on 30KB text.
	-AnalyzedTokenReadings now implements Iterable so it can be used in foreach loops
	-AnalyzedGermanTokenReadings has been removed, AnalyzedTokenReadings can be used instead

-Embedded HTTP server: the server now uses 10 threads instead of 1 (thanks to
	Panagiotis Minos)

-text extraction from Wikipedia dumps has been improved


2.2 (2013-06-30)

-Breton:
	-added/improved several rules
	-fixed some false alarms
	-updated POS dictionary from Apertium (svn r45122)

-Catalan:
	-added/improved many rules
	-fixed false alarms
	-rules have been categorized according to the upcoming Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)
	 Version 2.0 standard from W3C.

-Dutch:
	-updated rules to fix false alarms, thanks to Ruud Baars
	-The Dutch spell checking has been switched back to Hunspell for now to avoid too
	 many false alarms because of unknown compounds. Unfortunately, Dutch spell
	 checking does not provide suggestions anymore, for performance reasons.
	 The dictionary used is the one at
	 http://www.opentaal.org/bestanden/doc_download/20-woordenlijst-v-210g-voor-openofficeorg-3

	-new synthesizer dictionary
	-new spelling dictionary
	-new grammar rules
	-updated sentence tokenizer rules
	-disambiguator implemented
	-word tokenizer updated to ignore accent and soft hyphen and understand different apostrophes


-HTTP server:
	-enabling and disabling rules at the same time (keeping the rest of the default options) is now allowed.
	 To disable all the rules except those explicitly enabled, you can use the parameter enabledOnly=yes. Ex.:
	 http://localhost:8081/?language=en&enabled=STRANGE_RULE,ANOTHER_RULE&enabledOnly=yes&text=my+text

-Fix bug "java.lang.StringIndexOutOfBoundsException" in DifferentLengthRule
	(Ex.: http://localhost:8081/?language=ru&text=№&srctext=No.&motherTongue=en )

-Worked around the "There is an incompatible JNA native library installed on this system" error

-Updated Tika (used for language detection) from 0.9 to 1.3

-The "--version" parameter of languagetool-commandline.jar now also prints
	the build date

-Several small bug fixes, code cleanups, and Javadoc improvements


2.1 (2013-03-31)

-Breton:
	-added/improved several rules
	-fixed several incorrect suggestions thanks to added tests on corrections
	-spelling checker now ignores words with a POS tag, hence accepting words
	 which are in Apertium or in An Drouizig spelling checker
	-updated FSA spelling dictionary from An Drouizig Breton Spellchecker 0.11
	-updated POS dictionary from Apertium (svn r43173)

-Catalan:
	-added/improved several rules
	-fixed multiple false alarms
	-improved sentence and word tokenization
	-the tagger dictionary has been fixed and expanded (added 9000 nameplaces;
	 115000 tagged forms from Softcatalà dictionary)
	-verbal forms have been tagged according to regional variants (with script tag_verbs.pl)
	-Hunspell dictionary (Softcatalà) has been replaced with LT tagger dictionary for spellchecking
	-spelling checker now ignores words with a POS tag (from multiwords.txt or disambiguation.xml)

-English:
	-fixed some false alarms
	-added a few new rules
	-updated the tagger and synthesizer dictionaries to recognize more words, including
	 plural forms of nouns, new verbs, and missing cardinal numerals (fixes Sourceforge
	 bug #3560624)
	-updated the dictionary building script

-Esperanto:
	-added/improved several rules
	-fixed several incorrect suggestions thanks to added tests on corrections
	-single quotes at beginning/end of word no longer cause false spelling error

-French:
	-added/improved several rules
	-updated POS tag dictionary and Hunspell dictionary to Dicollecte-4.9
	-fixed several incorrect suggestions thanks to added tests on corrections
	-SRX sentence tokenization
	-single quotes at beginning/end of word no longer cause false spelling error

-German:
	-added/improved several rules
	-The German spell checker now returns suggestions. We combine Hunspell and our own
	 morfologik-based spell checker to create the suggestions for good performance,
	 but they are far from perfect yet. First, some misspelled compound words fail to have
	 a suggestion. Second, sometimes the best suggestion is not at the front of the list
	 of suggestions.
	 org/languagetool/resource/de/hunspell/create_dict.sh can be used to create
	 the three morfologik spell checker dictionaries (German, Austrian, and Swiss).
	-New language variant "Simple German", with rules contributed by Annika Nietzio.
	 This variant uses 'de-DE-x-simple-language' as a language code.

-Italian:
	-added/improved a few rules

-Malayalam:
	-now uses the default sentence tokenizer, not the English one (because languages
	 are now modules that don't depend on each other)

-Polish:
	-false alarm fixes
	-added and improved some rules
	-major tagger and synthesis dictionary update (to Morfologik 2.0 PoliMorf),
	 which also fixes sf.net bug #3554018

-Portuguese:
	-added/improved several rules
	-it now has over 1500 compound words

-Russian:
	-several new rules
	-bugfix: the uppercase sentence rule sometimes was not triggered


-spell checking: URLs, if specified like "http://www.foo.org", are now ignored and
	don't cause a spelling error anymore

-API: Languagetool has been split up into several Maven modules. This causes
	some API changes:
	-No more language constants: "Language.GERMAN" now needs to be "new German()",
	 similarly for all other languages
	-org.languagetool.gui.ResourceBundleWithFallback is now org.languagetool.ResourceBundleWithFallback
	-org.languagetool.gui.ContextTools is now org.languagetool.tools.ContextTools
	-LanguageIdentifierTools.ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES has been removed, languages are
	 detected at runtime now

-rule syntax: Suggestions are now also allowed outside the <message> element. Example:
		<message>Did you mean <suggestion>A</suggestion>?<message>
		<suggestion>B</suggestion>
		<suggestion>C</suggestion>
		<example type="incorrect" correction="A|B|C"><marker>asdf</marker></example>

-bugfix: suggestions for compounds parts were missing sometimes

-bugfix: Portuguese translation was not used

-bugfix: fix false alarm of unpaired bracket rule on smileys :-) and ;-)
	(Sourceforge bug #3604367)

-bugfix: testrules now report all cases when untouched examples were touched
	(Sourceforge bug #3600995)

-bugfix: the whitespace rule now reports also combinations of non-breaking space and white space
	characters (Sourceforge bug #3608410)

-stand-alone GUI: the very first check for languages with a lot of rules
	(e.g. German, French) should now be faster

-embedded HTTPS server:
	-two new properties, to be set from the property configuration file,
	 allow limiting the maximum number of requests:
		requestLimit - the maximum number of requests
		requestLimitPeriodInSeconds - the time period in which the requests are considered, in seconds
	-bugfix: only the first line of a POST request's body was considered

-OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration:
	-Another try to fix the ConcurrentModificationException (Sourceforge bug #3572536)

-Command line:
	-In verbose mode, the subId of disambiguator matched rules is displayed.

-Testing rules:
	-Now regular expressions in disambiguation rules are heuristically tested
	 (Sourceforge bug #3599002)


2.0 (2012-12-30)

-Breton:
	-added several new rules and fixed false alarms
	-updated POS dictionary (fix wrong POS tags) from Apertium (svn r42124)
	-updated FSA spelling dictionary from An Drouizig Breton Spellchecker 0.10
	-updated classification of words tagged as plural nouns of persons
	 (these have different mutation than other nouns)

-Catalan:
	-many new rules
	-fixed false alarms
	-multiple fixes and additions in the tagger dictionary
	-Hyphen is used as a word separator, as this is very common in web pages. This way some
	 ambiguities cannot be solved if the typography rule substituting hyphen for dash is disabled.
	 (For example: Dir-li -ho és important.)

-English:
	-uses the same word tokenizer again as other European languages
	-fix Sourceforge bug #3479817 (capitalization of the first item of a list not required)
	-a few rule updates

-Esperanto:
	-few new rules

-French:
	-updated POS tag dictionary and Hunspell dictionary to Dicollecte-4.8
	-fixed false alarms

-German:
	-many new rules and rule updates

-Portuguese:
	-Added hundreds of compound words
	-Added/improved several rules
	-Replaced the current dictionary with PT-pt (pre-language agreement).
	 To use the post-language agreement, use the PT-br one.

-Russian:
	-improved some rules
	-several new rules
	-updated POS dictionary (fix wrong POS Tags)

-Spanish:
	-several new rules (thanks to Alexander Socop Arango)

-Ukrainian:
	-updated a few rules


-OpenOffice/LibreOffice integration:
	-Fixed ConcurrentModificationException (Sourceforge bug #3572536)

-stand-alone GUI:
	-the tray icon menu (reachable with the right mouse button on the tray
	 icon) now has a checkbox to enable the embedded HTTP server
	-the tray icon will show a small "S" symbol when the server is running
	-fixed bug "Tray icon too big sometimes" (Sourceforge #3573078)

-API:
	-Language.getLanguageForShortName() now consistently throws an exception
	 if the given language code is not known
	-Tools.median() is now private (it was accidentally made public)
	-the Java API of HTTPServer has been modified in incompatible ways. You might get
	 compile errors if you have used this class from your Java code.

-HTTP API:
	-support for auto-detecting text language (parameter autodetect=1)
	-added HTTPSServer, a lightweight embedded HTTPS server which works like HTTPServer
	 but supports SSL encryption. This server supports *only* https, not http.
	-the XML we return now contains a new attribute "locqualityissuetype", which
	 is the "Localization Quality Issue Type" in the upcoming Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)
	 Version 2.0 standard from W3C. This means errors are now categorized according to
	 a standard, additionally to LanguageTool's own categories. Useful values are only
	 returned for English for now.
	 *** Please consider this to be a prototypical implementation for now ***
	 For the values and their meanings, please see

	 For rule developers: specify this using the new 'type' attribute. It is
	 inherited from category to rulegroup, and from rulegroup to rule. If a rule also
	 has the 'type' it overwrites the rulegroup's and category's 'type'.


1.9 (2012-09-30)

-Breton:
	 -several new rules and fixed false alarms
	 -the internal spelling engine can now additionally tokenize words if the
		source dictionary did not include compound versions (for example,
		hyphenated words).
	 -updated classification of words tagged as plural nouns of persons
		(these have different mutation than other nouns).

-Catalan:
	 -many new rules
	 -fixed false alarms

-Chinese:
	 -hundreds of new Chinese rules (Tao Lin)
	 -unit tests for the Chinese tokenizer and tagger

-Danish:
	 -major update to the dictionary and the rules (Henrik Bendt)

-English:
	 -fixed false alarm (sf bug #3543914)
	 -some new rules and rule updates

-Esperanto:
	 -several new rules and fixed false alarms
	 -updated list of transitive/intransitive verbs
	 -added <url> links to REVO (Reta Vortaro) with permission from Wolfram Diestel.

-French:
	 -updated POS tag dictionary to use Dicollecte-4.6
	 -several new rules and fixed false alarms
	 -opening guillemet (U+00AB) followed by thin no-break
		space (U+202F) wrongly detected as error (sf bug #3545050)

-German:
	 -added simple verb/subject agreement checker
	 -several new rules and rule updates
	 -fixed some false alarms by upgrading to jwordsplitter 3.4 (sf bug #3475553)

-Japanese:

-Russian:
	 -several new rules and rule updates
	 -improve user interface translation

-Swedish:
	 -Support for Swedish has been re-enabled after it had been disabled in LanguageTool 1.7.

-bugfix for command line: We removed XML from even plain text input. Now XML/HTML elements
	are only filtered out if the new --xmlfilter option is specified. Note that there's still
	a bug that can screw up position information with that option, thus it is deprecated.

-command line: new option "--list" to list all available languages

-introduced a file resources/<lang>/hunspell/ignore.txt with words that the spell checker
	will ignore

-development: new ant target generate-ignore-files: call "ant generate-ignore-files" if you
	want to re-generate the ignore.txt files, populated with those suggestions from the grammar
	files that the spell checker would complain about.
	In other words, this makes sure "simple" suggestions (i.e. those without back references) made
	by the LanguageTool rules are never considered spelling mistakes.
	If you have downloaded the stand-alone ZIP of LanguageTool, call this command for the
	same effect:
	java -cp LanguageTool.jar org.languagetool.rules.spelling.SuggestionExtractor

-stand-alone GUI: rules can now be disabled and re-enabled with a single click

-stand-alone GUI: copy and paste from the result area now keeps line breaks (Sourceforge
	bug #3554842)

-HTTP API: "+" was incorrectly removed from input (Sourceforge bug #3543914), patch by
	Sourceforge user hiddenspirit

-HTTP API: the XML returned by the "/Languages" URL (which returns a list of all supported
	languages) has been extended to contain an 'abbrWithVariant' attribute which lists the
	language with its variant, e.g.:
	<language name="Catalan" abbr="ca" abbrWithVariant="ca-ES"/>

-HTTP API: small internal cleanup for better exception and charset handling (always
	expects UTF-8)

-HTTP API: the embedded HTTP server can now be started with a "--public" parameter so
	it can be accessed from anywhere (not just localhost). Please be careful with this
	option, it is not recommended for production use:
	java -cp LanguageTool.jar org.languagetool.server.HTTPServer --public

-HTTP API and XML output: extended XML to include the version and build date
	of LanguageTool and the category and offset of each match

-The word tokenizer now considers the following characters as a word separator: | (pipe)
	and ` (backtick).

-bugfix: the column count was sometimes totally wrong (Sourceforge bug #3557738)


1.8 (2012-06-30)

-Greek:
	 -initial support for Greek with few rules for now (Panagiotis Minos)

-German:
	 -many new rules and rule updates
	 -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version; the dictionary used is the
		one by Franz Michael Baumann,
		see http://extensions.libreoffice.org/extension-center/german-de-de-frami-dictionaries
		LanguageTool can now detect spelling errors, but it does not offer suggestions
		for performance reasons
	 -added variants for Austria, Germany, and Switzerland
	 -added several thousand words to the internal dictionary for better
		error detection and less false alarms

-English:
	 -several rule improvements and new rules (Scott Kuhl)
	 -although a matter of debate, "an historic", "an historical", and "an habitual"
		is not considered incorrect anymore,
		also see http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/a%5B2%5D
	 -fixes in the tagger dictionary and disambiguation rules to reduce false alarms
	 -added British and American English spelling dictionaries
	 -added some rules to detect typical American expressions in British English

-Catalan:
	 -major update, including many new rules and new tokenization (Jaume Ortolà i Font)
	 -new synthesizer (given a part-of-speech, this generates the inflected word
		forms) (Jaume Ortolà i Font)
	 -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version
		using Hunspell dictionary ca-valencia (avl) 2.3.0 by Softcatalà

-Russian:
	 -fixed a few false alarms
	 -added URL element for some rules with URL with more information about this rule
	 -added spellcheck dictionary for standalone version.
	 -several rule improvements (adding links, improving messages)
	 -new Java rule "repeat word in sentence" (disabled by default)

-Italian:
	 -several new rules (Riccardo Murri and Agnese Dal Borgo)

-French:
	 -updated dictionary to use Dicollecte-4.5
	 -several new rules and fixed false alarms
	 -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version
		using Dicollecte-4.5 «classique & réforme 1990».

-Breton:
	 -updated dictionary to use Apertium svn r38896.
	 -several new rules and fixed false alarms
	 -added some references to the Breton grammar:
		"La grammaire bretonne pour tous (Eugène CHALM)".
	 -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version

-Polish:
	 -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version
	 -some new rules and fixed false alarms
	 -major update of the tagger dictionary

-Portuguese:
	 -initial support by Marco A.G. Pinto

-Esperanto:
	 -several new rules and fixed false alarms
	 -added <url> for further information about errors with links to
		PMEG (Plena Manlibro de Esperanto) with permission of its
		author Bertilo Wennergren, and to http://lernu.net also with
		permission of the lernu team.
	 -added spellcheck dictionary for the standalone version


-LibreOffice / OpenOffice integration:
	 -If a LanguageTool rule has an URL with more information, the
		grammar checking dialog in LibreOffice will now offer a "More..." link
		to that URL. That URL is also displayed on the command line and stand-alone
		user interface as "More info:", and as "url" attribute of the <error>
		element in the XML API format. This makes it possible to have external
		documentation about rules.
	 -Bugfix #3526635: SingletonFactory now implements XServiceInfo (Stephan Bergmann)
	 -Bugfix #3534637: Fixed false alarm about word being uppercase when the previous
		sentence ended with a footnote

-GUI:
	 -made the result of "Tag Text" a bit more readable
	 -Bugfix: when LT was hidden in the tray, two very fast mouse clicks could activate
		the check twice, and that caused errors. Right now only one checking thread is active.

-Command line:
	 -In verbose mode, the log of the rule-based disambiguator actions is displayed.
	 -In the profiling rules' mode on the command-line, you can now enable
		and disable rules.

-API:
	 -Deprecated some methods and the SentenceTokenizer class (SRXSentenceTokenizer
		should be used instead)

-LanguageTool in the standalone version now supports spell-checking. Some of the languages
	use hunspell (http://hunspell.sourceforge.net), some use LanguageTool-specific code.
	There are now two distribution files: a .zip file for standalone use,
	and an .oxt extension for LibreOffice/ApacheOpenOffice. All languages supported by
	LanguageTool, except for Chinese, have spelling dictionaries bundled with the standalone
	version. Spell-checking errors appear in red in the LanguageTool standalone
	version, other errors appear in blue.

-LanguageTool now supports separate rules for different local variants of a language,
	for example American English and British English. To use them from the command line,
	simply use "en-US" or "en-GB" as the language code. This implements sf.net feature
	suggestion #3287388.

-The configuration file now stores settings individually for all languages. This means
	that you can enable spellcheck for American English, disable it for Polish, and British
	English, and all these settings will be saved separately.

-If you start the HTTP Server from the GUI, it now reads the configuration files
	that are configured in the GUI (if the appropriate checkbox is set).
	This way the user can control the behavior of the server easily.

-Two new options for the HTTP Server added: "disabled" and "enabled", which is used
	to disable or enable rules in the same way as on the command-line.

-The XML format for rules has been changed to use <marker>...</marker> tags instead
	of mark_from and mark_to attributes.

-Overlapping rule matches are filtered now so that only the first match per <rulegroup> is kept

-It is now possible to suppress misspelled suggestions altogether in XML rules by applying
	an attribute suppress_misspelled="yes" on the <suggestion> element, AND on the <match>
	element. If only <match> element has this attribute set to "yes", then the suggestion is
	displayed, but no content of <match> is contained within (this might be a conditional part
	of the suggestion). Note: for this to work, the tagger dictionary needs to be fairly complete;
	words without lemmas and POS tags are considered to be misspelled.

-Improved startup speed (Jarek Lipski)

-Some internal bug fixing in disambiguation and pattern rules, including problems
	with unification.

-Update of morfologik-stemming library to 1.5.3 (bug-fix release).

-Larger tagger dictionaries were encoded in cfsa2 binary format to save space.

-Bugfix #3054895: fixed incorrect column reported by LanguageTool in command
	line mode or with --api option when error spanned new line.

-Bugfix #3431788: When the message contained the reference to a previous token as the first
	character, the corrections generated via regular expression replacements on match elements
	were wrong.


1.7 (2012-03-25)

-English:

		the rule that checks for uppercase sentence starts (Maksym Davydov)
-Swedish:
	 -Support for Swedish has been disabled because it was not actively maintained
		for a longer time and never reached a level that the old maintainer was happy
		with. It will be activated again as soon as a new maintainer is found, any
		help is welcome!

-bugfix: in LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org, the wrong error message was displayed
	for some rules (those that did not have a "short" message)

-bugfix: the "fromx" position in the XML output was wrong sometimes

-bugfix: the "contextoffset" position in the XML output was wrong
	when there were XML-escaped characters in the context

-consecutive tab characters are not considered an error anymore

-Ellipsis ("…") is no longer considered as a sentence separator (only relevant
	for languages not yet using SRX tokenizer).

-new optional rule element "url" (optional): an URL to a page that explains
	the rule leading to the error in more detail. Not used yet.

-GUI: errors are now marked with red background instead of red font
	so whitespace problems can easily be spotted

-Server mode: by default, the server only binds to localhost now. Although requests from
	non-localhost had been denied before by default, this should be more secure.

-Internal changes:
	 - adapted to a change in Unicode handling in Java 7 that broke support for Khmer
	 - added sanity check to detect duplicate exceptions in grammar rules.
	 - added sanity check to detect exceptions with scope="next" yet
		 without skip="..." in grammar rules.

-English:
	 -Fixed some of the problems in the Sourceforge bug #3396850 (false alarms)
-German:
	 -Extended the internal part-of-speech dictionary with
		about 2000 word forms. This should improve coverage of the

		for the source of the new data.
	 -Several new rules

		http://languagetool.wikidot.com/how-to-use-indexer-and-searcher-for-fast-rule-evaluation

-LanguageToolGUI and LanguageTool now have support for automatic language
	detection (Michael Bryant). On the command-line, you can use -adl or
	--autoDetect to enable automatic language detection.
	Also see http://languagetool.wikidot.com/adding-a-new-language-to-automatic-language-detection

-Internal changes:
	 -The disambiguator has a new action "immunize" that protects
		token from being matched by error-detecting rules (especially
		in XML rules).
	 -The disambiguator allows removing interpretations by specifying just some
		attributes with the <wd> tag.
	 -Allowed three character codes for languages, e.g. 'ast' for Asturian. This
		is the ISO 639-2 code, as Asturian doesn't seem to have an ISO 639-1
		two-character code.
	 -Fixed the bug with the special tag UNKNOWN: now it deals properly with
		the words at the end of sentence / paragraph.
	 -Languages now initialize their classes (tokenizers, part-of-speech taggers
		etc.) lazily, i.e. only when the classes are actually needed. Improves
		startup performance a bit.
	 -Switched to transifex.net for translation. Also changed our code to use the
		English string if no translation exists.

	-renamed SlovakVes to SlovakVesRule
	-renamed JLanguageTool.paragraphHandling to JLanguageTool.ParagraphHandling
	-removed deprecated GermanSentenceTokenizer

-It is now possible to add just a new POS tag using <wd> element in the
	disambiguator. If you omit the lemma attribute and/or the token, the token and
	the lemma will be set to the matched token.

-It is now possible to include skipped tokens from the sentence when referring
	to parts of the pattern in suggestions. Use include_skipped as attribute
	of the <match> element. To include all the tokens, including the one with the
	skip attribute set, use "all". To include only the skipped sequence, use "following"
	as the value of include_skipped. To include nothing, use "none".

-The syntax used for unification was slightly modified to make it more XML-friendly.
	The details are to be found on the wiki at
	http://languagetool.wikidot.com/using-unification

-DTD for disambiguation rules is now replaced by an XML Schema.

	in XML rules.

-Fixed a bug with the rule disambiguator: sentence end and paragraph end
	tags no longer get filtered out during disambiguation.

-Fixed a small bug with unification: now unifier used for rules and
	disambiguation rules are kept separate, so that you have different sets
	of unification equivalences, as defined in their files.

-Fixed a bug with footnote numbers before a comma that were reported
	as whitespace.

-Fixed sourceforge.net bug #2972055 (LanguageTool menu no longer appears in

	#2886208 for Spanish.
	For details, see
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&group_id=110216&atid=655717&aid=<ID>

-The simple replacement rule (designed originally only for Ukrainian)
	can be used now with any language to find simple, non-context dependent
	typos. Implemented now for Ukrainian, Russian, Romanian, and Polish.

-Added SRX-based sentence tokenizers for: Slovenian (thanks to Petra
	Galuscakova), Icelandic (thanks to Anton Karl Ingason), Slovenian
	(thanks to Martin Srebotnjak), and Russian (thanks to Yakov Reztsov).

	from AnalyzedTokenReadings when copying them.


0.9.9 (2009-05-22)

-Added preliminary support for Icelandic thanks to Anton
	Karl Ingason

-More English, Dutch, Polish and Romanian grammar rules.
	More English/Polish false friends. Improvements to Russian
	rules.

-Fixed some bugs with pairing brackets. Now the rule also
	complains about balanced parentheses put in the wrong
	order (like ")abc("), or overlapped with other symbols (like
	'his "mother'") and in all places the symbols weren't
	found to be balanced.

-Added sentence tokenizer that uses SRX format for
	specifying end-of-sentence breaks (for specification, see
	http://www.lisa.org/fileadmin/standards/srx20.html). This
	enhanced the quality and speed of sentence tokenization
	(for example, tokenizing the whole Brown corpus in the old
	tokenizer took 572613ms, while it takes 125971ms right now).
	Currently, English, Polish, Romanian and Dutch are using
	SRX segmentation rules.

-Added Dutch (Belgium) as a country variant to support it
	in OpenOffice.org.

-Updated Russian translation (Yakov Reztsov)

-Updated Slovenian translation and added more rules
	for this language (Martin Srebotnjak)

-Updated Slovak translation and added Slovak sentence
	tokenizer (Zdenko Podobný).

-Fixed a NullPointerException that could appear when using
	paragraph-level rules (SF bug # 2787814), removed bugs that lead to false positives
	in some English rules. Some code cleanup.

-Fixed a bug that truncated the suggested replacements for false
	friends.

-Fixed encoding problem for some systems (SF bug #2794857), thanks
	to Petr Mladek.

0.9.8 (2009-04-25)

-Much more new rules, rule-based disambiguator and synthesiser for
	Romanian (thanks to Ionuț Păduraru)

-New rules for Italian and translation of messages into Italian
	by Paolo Bianchini

-Initial support for Slovak, including new rules by Zdenko Podobný

-Translation of messages into Slovak by Zdenko Podobný

-Small fixes and additions for Polish and English. Small dictionary
	update for English.

-Now sentences written in different languages in OpenOffice.org
	are recognized as such and checked properly (previously it was
	assumed that the whole paragraph has always the same language).

-New mode of operation on command-line: you can apply suggestions
	automatically by supplying "--apply" switch (or "-a" for short).
	LanguageTool will then output a text with suggestions applied,
	while suppressing all other text (you can, however, still get
	verbose output on STDERR). This way LanguageTool may be used to
	automatically edit a text (to clean a corpus before some other
	operations, for example).  Note: only the first suggestion is
	applied in the automatic mode, so make sure that the first
	suggestion is the best one.

-The command-line tool works now with STDIN. STDIN is activated
	anytime a filename is not specified or if you specified "-"
	explicitly.

-Update of morfologik-stemming library to version 1.1.4
	fixes a NullPointerException (sf bug #2613574) and some
	problems with UTF-8 dictionaries.

-Now it's possible to test disambiguation XML rules in a similar
	manner that error-matching rules are tested. Look in English
	disambiguation rules for examples (at the end of the file).

-Taggers recognize now mistyped lowercase words that should be
	uppercase.

-Fixed a bug that disallowed using rules that were turned off by
	default.

-Added more tests and fixed some position errors in the XML rules and
	disambiguation rules.

-Fixed some glitches with line numbers, time statistics and
	match numbers, and unknown words when checking large files
	on the command line. Fixed a bug with case conversion in rules
	that contained element <match> in suggestions and numerical
	references such as \1 in the message.


0.9.7 (2009-03-03)

-Small updates to Polish disambiguation rules, German
	error rules, and English dictionary

-Updates for Dutch error rules

-Fixed bugs in Russian rules (Sourceforge bug #2545548 and #2545525),
	thanks to Yakov.

-Preliminary support for Romanian (thanks to Ionuţ Păduraru)

-Fixed a ClassCastException crash that occurred with non-English
	texts that contain soft-hyphens.

-Fixed bug with no errors visible in context menu for some languages
	in OpenOffice.org, for example French.

0.9.6 (2009-01-21)

-Support for new Proofreading API in OpenOffice 3.0.1. The
	non-native dialog box used for checking the text in LT was
	removed as it duplicated the native function and was buggy
	(see for example sf bug #1943695).

-The toolbar button became redundant and was removed. A new
	menu command "Recheck document" was added to start a new check
	and reset the rules set as ignored during the previous check
	(the rules disabled in the configuration dialog are not
	enabled on recheck).

-Added possibility to specify feature unification (introduced
	in XML files but the implemented mechanism is general).

-Added new features to the rule disambiguator, such as unification,
	filtering, deleting and adding interpretations. Fixed some
	small bugs.

-Added a tagger dictionary for Russian (thanks to Yakov).

-Added compounds rule for English and Polish, and made the
	existing compound rule easily extensible for new languages.

-Added possibility to add shorter comments for rules to be
	displayed in OpenOffice.org 3.x context menus.

-New command-line option -t or --taggeronly can be used to
	tag a text file with POS tags and lemmas as seen by LanguageTool.
	This means that you can use LanguageTool as a standalone
	tagger for testing or for building a corpus.

-The rule that checks for whitespace surrounding punctuation
	marks now detects an orphaned full stop as requested by OOo
	users (http://www.openoffice.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=93931).

-Added a possibility to check if there is a whitespace before a
	token in XML rules (simply specify attribute spacebefore="yes";
	possible values are also "no" and "ignore". "ignore" is the
	default.)

-Added new English, Dutch, Polish and Russian rules. Fixed false
	alarms for many English rules (including 'a vs. an' rule) based
	on the community.languagetool.org user votes and sourceforge.net
	tracker reports (#2319686, #2319670, #2381522). Fixed false
	alarms for many Dutch (thanks to R.J. Baars) and Polish rules.

-Massive corrections and additions to the English tagger lexicon. Added
	a lot of new disambiguation rules for English.

-Massive corrections to the Dutch tagger and synthesizer lexicon (thanks
	to R.J. Baars).

-Corrections to the Polish tagger and synthesizer lexicon. Added
	rule-based disambiguator for Polish.

-The scripts testrules.bat and testrules.sh are now also testing
	the validity of XML files, including false friends, rules and
	disambiguator rules.

-Fixed problems with uppercase sentence start rule with lists for Russian
	and Polish (thanks to Yakov Reztsov).

-Fixed a bug in synthesizer suggestions generated for indeterminate
	articles before compound words (such as 'all-inclusive').

-Fixed a bug that could cause errors in XML error/disambiguation rule
	matching.

-Fixed a bug that could cripple case conversion of tokens matched in
	suggestions formatted with regular expressions.

-Fixed a bug that resulted from missing synchronization of code used
	for doing actual grammar-check in OpenOffice.org (see sf bugs #2416655,
	#2411768, #2379365).

-Fixed other small bugs (rule numbering in text output; archaic words
	offered in some English suggestions; ignoring some exceptions that
	were set for preceding tokens; incorrect positions of errors on some
	tagged punctuation tokens; incorrect formatting of some synthesized
	suggestions; ignoring manual hyphenation marks during checking in
	OpenOffice.org; not printing unknown words on command-line).

0.9.5 (2008-11-02)

-Fixed a bug in whitespace rule that caused LT to crash
	OpenOffice.org with English text.

-Fixed a bug that caused some languages to be wrongly
	tagged in Turkish Unicode locale (reported by Serkan Kaba).

	algorithm which could cause false alarms.

-Added full support for various Unicode whitespace
	characters and tabs as word separators for English.

	in OpenOffice.org and formatting of comments visible in the
	context menu.

-Fixes in Polish sentence tokenizer that allow some abbreviations
	and symbols at the end of sentences.

-Fixed sentence tokenizer: the footnote at the end of the sentence
	caused LT not to break the sentence at all.

0.9.4 (2008-09-30)

-Fixed freezing on startup with OpenOffice.org 3.0.

-Updated Swedish rules, added false friends, and
	fixed the compounds rule (thanks to Niklas Johansson).

-Updated French dictionary, disambiguation rules
	and grammar rules (thanks to Camille Moulin).

-Added abbreviations for Russian sentence tokenizer and
	Russian compound rule. Updated Russian rules (thanks
	to Yakov Reztsov).

-LanguageTool button in OpenOffice.org is now placed next to
	the "Spelling and Grammar" button.

-It is now possible to turn the whole category of rules
	by default off (in the XML file).


0.9.3 (2008-08-06)

-Works with OpenOffice.org 3.0 beta m26 or later.
	LanguageTool.jar needed to be removed from classpath.
	Added support for the new grammar checking API (displays
	blue wavy lines for errors automatically, a context
	menu with suggestions, rechecks document when options
	changed...). With the new API, it is possible to check
	documents with multiple languages. When using the blue
	wavy lines, all known previous bugs with OpenOffice.org
	were solved; note that OpenOffice.org 3.0 "Spell and Grammar
	Check" dialog is *not* completely implemented yet.
	Sometimes you need to use our slightly buggy dialog instead
	(progress dialog is always on top to solve focus problems).

-Added full support for various Unicode whitespace
	characters as word separators (including typographic
	space characters).

-Added support for Russian (thanks to Yakov Reztsov).

-Fixed the bug that caused that "&" was shown in buttons,
	and not interpreted as shortcut.

-Fixed menu and toolbar icon which were broken
	during compilation (black square or empty).

-Fixed a small bug with formatting some case-sensitive
	suggestions.

-Added a generic rule that detects redundant whitespace.

-Added Dutch synthesizer for making suggestions based
	on part-of-speech changes.

-Added a rule-based disambiguator for English to minimize
	false alarms.

-New Dutch, English (dealing with agreement and redundancy),
	Polish and Swedish rules. Added more false friends. Removed
	some false alarms.

-The German tagger now splits compounds words correctly which
	avoids several mistaggings and thus false alarms.

-Added new Swedish tagger for more complex rules, thanks to
	Niklas Johansson.

-The command line client now prints a number after the
	rule id so you can see which of the rules in a rule group
	it refers to, for example:
	"2.) Line 1, column 43, Rule ID: MUEHLHEIM_A_D_RUHR[1]"

0.9.2 (2008-02-17)

-LanguageTool is now part of the "Tools" menu in
	OpenOffice.org and its toolbar button is docked to
	standard toolbar by default.

-LanuageTool's OpenOffice.org configuration is now saved
	in the user's home directory.

-Added preliminary support for Swedish (thanks to Niklas
	Johansson).

-More false friends, especially Polish-English, and
	generalization of existing false friend rules for English
	and German.

-Added possibility to display a false friend list as
	a dictionary formatted in HTML (rules/print-ff.xsl).

-Added an attribute to the DTD so XML rules and groups
	of rules can be disabled by default by specifying
	default="off". Java rules can be set as turned off by
	default by using setDefaultOff() method.
	Both settings can be overridden in the Options dialog
	box.

-Added possibility to set hot keys for UI items in
	translation. Corrected French translation (thanks to
	Hugo Voisard).

-Fixed bug in OOo extension that caused that false friend
	rules did not display in the configuration dialog.

-Added the possibility to disable complete rule groups
	(categories) in the GUI.

-Fixed some Polish rules. Added more Dutch rules and several
	hundred more French rules.

-XML rules: added possibility to refer to matched tokens'
	POS in <match> elements inside <token>. This is useful
	for defining agreement without combinatorial explosion.

-OOo extension will be distributed in .oxt format that
	allows automatic updates.

-Internal change: updated tagger library and streamlined
	some tagger code.

0.9.1 (2007-09-17)

-Fixed a bug with the resource paths that was discovered
	in OpenOffice.org 2.3 and that made it impossible to use
	LanguageTool with OpenOffice.org 2.3.

-XML rules: enabled referring to whole phrases in suggestions, and
	changing their POS tags appropriately. Added support for attribute
	scope="previous" in exceptions.

-Fixed error marking problems for XML rules that use phrases
	and skipping.

-Added and tweaked some Polish and English rules.

-Fixed problems with badly written XML rules that used skipping.

-LanguageTool now requires Java 6.0 to be compiled, but it
	still runs with Java 5.0.

-The icon in the system tray now offers a menu when clicking
	the right mouse button (Java 6.0 only).

-Several people had problems with the LanguageTool dialog
	appearing in the background (when using LanguageTool inside
	OpenOffice.org). A workaround has been added that tries
	to fix this problem.

-The embedded webserver can now work with UTF-8. Input must
	now always be in UTF-8 (or 7-Bit ASCII, as that is a subset of
	UTF-8).

-Fixed bug (#1726044 in sf.net tracking system) concerning the
	Italian tagger dictionary that resulted in a badly formatted
	dictionary file.

-The stand-alone LanguageTool can now load an XML rule file using
	the new menu item "Add language...". This way people can write
	rules and use without touching any Java code and without the need
	for the rule file to be distributed with LanguageTool.
	Currently, the file must be named in the format "rules-xx-name.xml",
	where "xx" is the two-character language code and "name" is the full
	name of the language in English. Example: rules-en-English.xml
	TODO: needs more polishing: i18n, store and load configuration, add
	the same to OOo

0.9 (2007-05-20)

-It's possible to edit rules using XML Mind XML Editor (xxe) in a
	WYSYWIM (what you see is what you mean) mode. Simply open the file
	in xxe, and it should display in a form input mode. It is recommended
	that you uncheck Options > Preferences > Save > Add open lines. Set
	a high value in Max line length.

-Now you can simply open rule files (rules/<language>/grammar.xml) with
	Firefox to see examples of errors and descriptions of rules in a
	human-readable format.

-A lot of new French rules by Agnes Souque (mostly grammar errors) and
	Hugo Voisard (mostly stylistic errors).

-Everyone can now develop, modify, and test grammar rules without requiring
	the LanguageTool source code. Just call this command, it will run all
	tests in all grammar.xml files (tests are the sentences in the
	<example>...</example> tags). If you work in Linux, type:
	sh testrules.sh
	In Windows command line, type:
	testrules.bat

-German compound nouns are now split so that also compound words
	which are not in the dictionary are recognized. This way more
	agreement errors can be detected, e.g. "die Donaudampfschiff".
	The dictionary for jWordSplitter was created using the new class
	ExportGermanNouns.

-New option -u or --list-unknown for the command line version: lists
	all words that are not known, i.e., words without POS information.
	This currently also lists words written with an uppercase first
	letter unless they appear at the beginning of a sentence.

-Added support for variables in XML pattern rules and disambiguation
	rules; it is now possible to refer to previously matched tokens using
	<match> element.

-Added support for logical AND operation for combining tokens
	in error pattern and disambiguation rules (XML-based). In other
	words, all possible logical combinations are now available in
	the rule declaration.

-Added support for XML-based rule disambiguation of POS tags
	(based on an idea by Agnes Souque).

-Added support for regular expressions and POS tags to
	create complex suggestions (for example, suggesting another
	grammatical case or a word without an apostrophe). Suggestions
	based on selecting POS tags require a special synthesis dictionary,
	compiled for the language. Currently, two such dictionaries are
	available: for English and Polish.

-Added initial support for Slovenian (Martin Srebotnjak)

-Fixed and refined some faulty suggestions for Polish, English, and
	Spanish rules.

-Added special POS tag value "UNKNOWN" that matches any token without
	any part of speech token. Useful for matching proper names
	or misspelled words that are not in the dictionary.

-The tray icon should now also work on the Mac.

-Added option to test suggested replacements in internal quality
	tests.

-Refined and added more Polish and English rules with new suggestion
	features.

-Fixed bug with saving preference for mother tongue (for false
	friend checking) in the stand-alone GUI and OOo extension.

-Fixed bug for users that have Windows username with special
	characters; OpenOffice.org extension can now read its files
	correctly.

-Internal change: changed source directory structure; now files
	are accessed based on the classpath and not file structure
	(more portable way).

0.8.9 (2007-04-07)

-Security: The embedded webserver didn't escape HTML when an error
	message was returned which led to the possibility to inject
	Javascript via cross site scripting (thanks to "sumit")

-A lot of new Polish rules

-Improved German rules to give less false alarms

-Improved English rules

-Added initial support for Czech (by Jozef Licko)

-Added initial support for Ukrainian (by Andriy Rysin)

-Make OpenOffice.org integration work with NeoOffice (by Ray Hazlip)

-Added disambiguator interface used to filter POS tags (by Jozef Licko)

-Enabled use of much more compact dictionaries for languages with
	heavy use of infixes or prefixes (mostly Slavic languages).

-Fixed a bug with suggestions for some rules that match correlated
	words in the sentence, and a bug with matching in some of them.

-New UnpairedQuotesBracketsRule (for pairing (), [], {}, „”, »«,
	depending on the language); works on a paragraph-level. Additionally,
	new mechanisms for paragraph- and text-level rules were introduced.

-New French punctuation rule for inserting a non-breakable
	space before '!', '?', ':', and ';' and after or before
	French quotation marks ('«' and '»').

-Fixed crash when started in an unsupported locale

-Added support for declaring phrases (or chunks) in rules,
	which allows reusing same structures in various rules. This
	could be thought of as simplified chunking.

-The command line version (LanguageTool.jar) can now be started
	from any directory. In previous versions, you had to be in the
	LanguageTool installation directory to start it.

-Internal change: rules are loaded dynamically to make adding
	a new language easier in the future (patch by Andriy Rysin)

0.8.8 (2007-01-30)

-XML output of HTTP interface changed for compatibility with
	An Gramadoir (http://borel.slu.edu/gramadoir/), see
	resource/api-output.dtd for the new format. Fixed some encoding
	problems with the HTTP response.

-Added --api option to Main method so the XML output can be tested
	on the command line.

-Improved English, Dutch and Polish rules

-Fixed several false alarms in German agreement rule (e.g., for "Dies liegt
	aller Kommunikation zugrunde." and "Der Vorgang, der soziale Akteure
	miteinander verknüpft.")

-Improved German coherency rule, e.g. using "Ketchups" and "Ketschups"
	in one document will lead to an error

-German part-of-speech information can now be added to resource/de/added.txt

-Slightly improved suggestions of German compound rule, e.g., "x mal"
	will suggest "x-mal", not "xmal"

-Fixed false alarm in German "wieder vs. wider" rule

-Command line version now stops with error message if unknown options
	are used

0.8.7 (2006-12-31)

-Extended and improved English, Polish, and Dutch rules

-Added some Lithuanian rules (Thanks to Mantas Kriaučiūnas)

-Improved UppercaseSentenceStartRule for sentences that start with a
	quote character

-Bugfix: Small fixes for German compound rule (e.g., "New Yorker" and
	"New-Yorker" are both okay)

-Bugfix: Don't crash but show error if LanguageTool is used with Java <= 1.4
	inside OpenOffice.org

-Bugfix: LanguageTool stopped with a MissingResourceException when started
	in a locale that's not supported (e.g., fr_CA = French, Canada)

-Added French translation of the GUI (Thanks to Hugo Voisard)

0.8.6 (2006-12-17)

-Added support for Dutch (Thanks to Ruud J. Baars)

-Added initial support for Lithuanian (no XML rules yet)

-Error rules slightly improved for English, German, and Polish

-Small improvements to the sentence tokenizer

-Command line version and stand-alone version now print suggested fixes

-New rule for German that complains about the spelling of compound words
	that are written as separate words, e.g., for "System Administrator"
	LanguageTool suggests "System-Administrator" and "Systemadministrator".
	See resource/de/compounds.txt for a list of words that this rule detects.

-OpenOffice.org integration:
		-fixed that some errors messages (e.g., Language not supported) could freeze
		 the OpenOffice.org GUI
		-the "server mode" configuration is now only available in a stand-alone
		 mode, as it doesn't make sense inside OpenOffice.org
		-configuration dialog is now mostly translated
		-error marking corrected for documents that contain index markers
		-improved icon

-Stand-alone GUI:
		-improved tray icon
		-added shortcuts for its menu items
		-new menu item "Check Text in Clipboard"
		-will now hide itself to the system tray when
		 clicking the window close button when started in system tray mode
		 (with -t or --tray). Use "Quit" from the menu to exit the program
		 completely.
		-user interface is now mostly translated

-Debugging output (-v) of German texts has been improved, it now shows the
	part-of-speech tags as they are used during rule matching

0.8.5 (2006-10-30)

-Fixed small bugs connected with special HTML characters used
	internally and entities encoding

-OpenOffice.org integration: documents > 64K can now be checked
	WARNING: There's still a problem with documents that contain tables,
	the wrong part of the text will be selected.

-OpenOffice.org integration: progress dialog now really shows the progress

-Introduced new POS tags for uncountable nouns (NN:U) and for nouns
	that can be used as uncountable (NN:UN). Added most common proper names
	to the English tagger dictionary.

-LanguageTool can now run as a server that returns its results
	in a simple XML format via HTTP. Activate the server using
	"File -> Options..." or start it via command line using
	java -cp jaminid.jar:LanguageTool.jar de.danielnaber.languagetool.server.HTTPServer

-By default, a single linebreak is not supposed to be a paragraph
	delimiter anymore (this was introduced in 0.8.4). With the command
	line application, you can use the new option -b to make LanguageTool
	take single linebreaks as paragraphs delimiters again. Two consecutive
	linebreaks are always considered a paragraph boundary (and thus a
	sentence boundary).

-Added initial French, Spanish and Italian support

-Added new rules for English and Polish

0.8.4 (2006-08-20)

-Added several new rules for English, German, and Polish

-The false friend rules now offer a possible correction

-Stand-alone GUI: the program can now be docked to the system tray.
	Selecting any text and clicking on the icon in the system tray pops up
	the main window and checks the selected text. You need to unzip
	standalone-libs.zip for this feature to work (this was necessary so
	OpenOffice.org, which works on the same ZIP, doesn't get confused).

-Stand-alone GUI: now stores its configuration to a file ".languagetool.cfg"
	in the user's home directory. Still buggy, as it only stores the configuration
	for one text language.

-OpenOffice.org integration: cursor doesn't jump to start anymore before it
	selects the error

-OpenOffice.org integration: LanguageTool's suggestions can now be accepted
	using a double click

-A single line break in texts will now be interpreted as the end of a
	paragraph thus also as the end of a sentence.

-Reduced size of LanguageTool by using a more compact
	part-of-speech tagger

-Changed DTD to support more XML-like rule encoding, added categories

-Extended exception matching to multiple tokens, added more flexible ways
	to match variable word order languages (via skipping tokens in rules)

-Added lemmatization support, regular expression support

-Added AnalyzedTokenReadings class to support multiple readings
	in all taggers, changed the code appropriately

-Some API changes

0.8.3 (2006-06-25)

-Requires Java 1.5 now

-Support for Polish (Marcin Milkowski)

-Fixed a NullPointerException in DoublePunctuationRule

-Added information to the README about how to compile LanguageTool for
	.NET using IKVM

-OpenOffice.org: The selection of the potentially incorrect text was wrong
	after paragraphs (on Windows only)

0.8.2 (2006-02-26)

-New menu entry "Configuration..."

-If you're a native speaker of German and write a text in English, LanguageTool
	can now warn you if you're using a "false friend", i.e., an English word that sounds
	like a German word but has a different meaning (e.g., become <-> bekommen).
	This also works vice versa (i.e., English native speakers will get a warning
	when writing a German text using a false friend).

-Added a few new pattern rules

-Missing whitespace after a comma is now detected

-Added a new German rule that detects missing agreement in e.g.,
	"meine Auto" (correct: "mein Auto"). This also introduces some new
	false alarms.

-Errors for German text are now displayed in German

-Several other small fixes

-Only relevant for developers: changes to rules.dtd (affect "lang" attribute)

-Only relevant for developers: XML validation doesn't happen at runtime
	anymore but only when "ant test" is called

0.8.1 (2005-12-22)

-Made it work for cases where the add-on installation path contains
	spaces (often seems to be the case under Windows)

-Added a few rules for English

-Added more exceptions so the English "a vs. an" rule works better

-Other small fixes

0.8 (2005-12-17)

-Added OpenOffice.org integration. Install the LanguageTool ZIP via
	Tools -> Package Manager -> Add..., re-start OpenOffice.org and you'll
	have a new menu item "LanguageTool" which checks your text.

-The German data is now more compact (but still 40MB when uncompressed)
	and it's included in the standard distribution

-Fixed morphology data for a few German words

-Added some new simple pattern rules for English and German

-Switched to new English part-of-speech data and new version of
	part-of-speech tagger (OpenNLP-tools 1.3)

-Files are called LanguageTool instead of JLanguageTool again
	as the Java version is the only maintained version anyway

0.7.2 (2005-11-21)

-several new pattern rules for typical German and English typos

-new rule that checks for ".." and ",,"

-new CaseRule for German text: complains if non-nouns are written
	in uppercase and checks uppercase spelling of "substantivierte Verben",
	e.g., "Das Laufen fällt mir leicht."

-extension of pattern synatx: DT^foo|bar will match words tagged
	as "DT", except the word is "foo" or "bar"

-fixed several false alarms (i.e., rules matching text which is
	actually correct)

-fixed error marking for matches of pattern rules

-fixed morphology data for these German words: Papagei, Virus, Stasi

0.7.1 (2005-09-08)

-Rules can now be enabled/disabled in GUI

-the error displayed to the user is now taken from the "message"
	element, not from the "name" attribute anymore

-implemented mark_from and mark_to attributes, these can
	be used to expand/shrink the area of text that is marked
	as wrong. Both attributes default to 0 so that the text
	marked as wrong is exactly the one that matches the pattern.

-back references like \1 can now be used in error messages
	to refer to the parts of the original text that is matched
	by the pattern

-a few German noun phrases like "der große Mann" are now checked
	for agreement. For example, "des großer Mannes" is detected
	as incorrect. This requires data in rules/de/categories which needs
	to be downloaded separately.

-a new rule checks whether a sentence starts with an uppercase letter

0.7 (2005-08-15)

-first release of Java rewrite
