# LanguageTool

**A proof-reading tool for English, Spanish, German,
Polish, Chinese, French, Russian, Italian, Dutch
and [more languages](https://www.languagetool.org/languages/)**

Version 3.4-SNAPSHOT, 2016-xx-yy  
Copyright (C) 2005-2016 the LanguageTool community and Daniel Naber (www.danielnaber.de)  
Homepage: https://www.languagetool.org


## Requirements

* Java 8 or later
* For LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org integration:
    * LibreOffice 3.5.4 (or later) or
    * Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 (or later)


## Usage

### LibreOffice/OpenOffice

To integrate LanguageTool into LibreOffice or OpenOffice.org, you can use two methods:

1. Double-click `LanguageTool-3.3.oxt`. The extension should
   start installing. Follow the on-screen instructions.

2. If the above method doesn't work, call `Tools > Extension
   Manager > Add...` in OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice and browse for the
   `LanguageTool-3.3.oxt` file.

Close and restart LibreOffice/OpenOffice.org Writer. Remember to close
the QuickStarter as well if you use it. Type text with
an error, e.g. "Feel tree to do so." - make sure the text language
is set to English for this example.

You should see a blue underline under the word "tree" after about a second.
Opening the context menu with the right mouse button on that word
offers you a short description of the error and a correction ("free").

If you are using LibreOffice and you want to check English or Russian texts:
Use `Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids -> Edit...` in the
`Tools` menu to disable LightProof and enable LanguageTool for English.

Note that there will also be a new menu item "LanguageTool"
under the `Tools` menu.
If the native spelling and grammar dialog doesn't check grammar,
make sure that the check box `Check Grammar` is checked in it
(if the window closes because of no mistakes in the document,
simply make any spelling mistake to make it open for a longer
time, and check the box). Check also if LanguageTool is visible
under `Grammar` in `Tools > Options > Language Settings > Spelling`
for your language. Note: you can disable the grammar check without
uninstalling LanguageTool simply by clearing the check box next to
LanguageTool in the same dialog.
  
Please see https://www.languagetool.org/issues/ if you experience problems.

### Stand-alone version

To use the stand-alone version, double click on the `languagetool.jar` file
or call `java -jar languagetool.jar` from the command line.

### Command-line version

To check plain text files from the command line, use

    java -jar languagetool-commandline.jar -l xx <filename>

with `xx` being the code for your language, e.g. `en-US` for American English
or just `en` for English without spell checking activated.


## Source code history

On 2013-08-08 we moved our source code from Subversion at Sourceforge to
git at github (https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool). Most
history has been preserved. History in git is lost for:

* binary files
* branches and tags

If you need this history, the old subversion repository is still available
at http://svn.code.sf.net/p/languagetool/code/trunk/languagetool/.
