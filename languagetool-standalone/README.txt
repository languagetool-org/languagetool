(see http://www.languagetool.org/languages/ for a list)

Copyright (C) 2005-2013 Daniel Naber (naber at danielnaber de)
Version 2.3-SNAPSHOT, 2013-xx-yy
Homepage: http://www.languagetool.org

Requirements:
 -Java 6.0 or later (Oracle Java or IcedTea; GIJ is not supported)
 -For OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice integration: OpenOffice 3.0.1 or later
  or LibreOffice. We recommend LibreOffice 3.5.4 (or later) or
  Apache OpenOffice 3.4.1 (or later) because they contain an
  important bug fix.

Usage:
 -To integrate LanguageTool into OpenOffice.org or LibreOffice, you
  can use two methods:
 
 1. Double-click LanguageTool-2.1.oxt. The extension should
  start installing. Follow the on-screen instructions.
 
 2. If the above method doesn't work, call Tools > Extension 
  Manager > Add... in OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice and browse for the
  LanguageTool-2.1.oxt file. 
  
  Close and restart OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Writer. Remember to close
  the QuickStarter as well if you use it. Type text with
  an error, e.g. "This is an test." - make sure the text language 
  is set to English for this example.
  You should see a blue underline under the word "an". Opening
  the context menu with the right mouse button offers you a
  description of the error and, if available, a correction.

  If you are using LibreOffice 3.5+ and you want to check English texts:
  Use Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids -> Edit... to disable
  LightProof and enable LanguageTool for English.
  
  If you are using LibreOffice 3.5+ and you want to check Russian texts:
  Use Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids -> Edit... to disable
  LightProof and enable LanguageTool for Russian.

  Note that there will also be a new menu item "LanguageTool"
  under the "Tools" menu.
  If the native spelling and grammar dialog doesn't check grammar,
  make sure that the check box "Check Grammar" is checked in it
  (if the window closes because of no mistakes in the document,
  simply make any spelling mistake to make it open for a longer
  time, and check the box). Check also if LanguageTool is visible
  under "Grammar" in Tools > Options > Language Settings > Spelling
  for your language. Note: you can disable the grammar check without
  uninstalling LanguageTool simply by clearing the check box next to
  LanguageTool in the same dialog.
  
  Please see http://www.languagetool.org/issues/ if you
  experience problems
  
 -To use the simple demo GUI, double click on the languagetool-standalone.jar file
  or call 'java -jar languagetool-standalone.jar'

 -To check plain text files from the command line:
  java -jar languagetool-commandline.jar <filename>
